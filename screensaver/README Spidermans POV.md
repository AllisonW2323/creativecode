# Spidermans POV

I created an interesting screen saver by using the code for a torus, on the P5js.org website, and how it moves and then applying that to the "snow" effect so that the "snow" now moves at a very interesting pace and style that I like to think of as Spidermans POV.  I like that when it creates the image on the screen when it is mostly filled (but still filling in as it is contuinous) it looks like it is shaded to represent two sides of a building that go down to a narrow street, hence, why I think that Spidermans POV is a good title.

I believe that the way I have my code set up it can be easily changed to fit the media wall.  As of now it is set to 400, 400 as our Professor instructed.  

I decided to leave the background blank becuase my inspiration for this was the bubbles screensaver ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptp5wjk7sS4that) I alwasy loved when I was younger.  In that screensaver the bubbles just move around your normal desktop or whatever you have pulled up so I decided to do the same where the many dots would slowly cover your entire screen.

I have just sat and watched this screensaver go for many minutes.  Just like the old timey ribbons screensaver (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cElhIDdGz7M) this entraces and you can easily zone out and just focus on what is happening on the screen, as your eyes make up whatever image you want to see.


The inspiration for my project is both the bubbles and the ribbons screensaver for windows.


This project has gone through a lot of changes as I found out new methods and crated new ideas for what could be done.  As of now I am sufficently happy with how my project turned out and how it looks.  I am really happy I was able to create my own thing.

I can see someone easily getting some *enhancments* an just starring at my screen saver for an hour or two.
P.S. If you look closely you can see a particular shape moving around the screen to create the paths which the colors stay on.
