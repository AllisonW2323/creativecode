# Spidermans POV


Here is a link to my code on p5js.org: https://editor.p5js.org/AllisonW2323/sketches/oM390zoWa

I created an interesting screen saver by using the code for a torus, on the P5js.org website, and how it moves and then applying that to the "snow" effect so that the "snow" now moves at a very interesting pace and style that I like to think of as Spidermans POV.  I like that when it creates the image on the screen when it is mostly filled (but still filling in as it is continuous) it looks like it is shaded to represent two sides of a building that go down to a narrow street, hence, why I think that Spidermans POV is a good title.  Also, comic books historically have a kind of dot texture that they used to color so I like that this is a nod to that practice by having my dots make up a picture.

I believe that the way I have my code set up it can be easily changed to fit the media wall.  As of now it is set to 400, 400 as our Professor instructed.  

I have always loved painting so the idea that these dots were falling from a paintbrush unto a black canvas was really interesting to me.  I am really happy how it turned out and that the 3-D aspect worked so that I was able to give it depth.

I have just sat and watched this screensaver go for many minutes.  Just like the old timey ribbons screensaver (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cElhIDdGz7M) this entrances the viewer and you can easily zone out and just focus on what is happening on the screen as your eyes make up whatever image you want to see.


The inspiration for my project is both the process of painting and the ribbons screensaver for windows.


This project has gone through a lot of changes as I found out new methods and crated new ideas for what could be done.  As of now I am sufficiently happy with how my project turned out and how it looks.  I am really happy I was able to create my own thing.

I can see someone easily getting some *enhancements* and just starring at my screen saver for an hour or two.
P.S. If you look closely you can see a particular shape moving around the screen to create the paths which the colors stay on.
