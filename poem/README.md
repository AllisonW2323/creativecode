# Treasure Poem

This project is a poem that I made with the text from Treasure Island.  

The meaning behind the work that I have made is that a short poem made up of nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the right odrer can allow a computer to make it's own poem through the lens of an existing work.
I love the way my poem bot takes apart Treasure Island and puts it back together adjective, noun, and verb seperated to form a totally different sentence than what was origionally intended.  I made it add a real sentence from the novel so that my poem has at least a bit of context then I brought it back around so that the ending words were, once again, parts of a sentence that were added to create a new story for the poem.
