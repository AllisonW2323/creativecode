ACT I
PROLOGUE
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
SAMPSON
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREGORY
No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
GREGORY
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
SAMPSON
I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMPSON
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
SAMPSON
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
GREGORY
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.
SAMPSON
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.
GREGORY
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMPSON
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.
GREGORY
The heads of the maids?
SAMPSON
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREGORY
They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMPSON
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.
SAMPSON
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
GREGORY
How! turn thy back and run?
SAMPSON
Fear me not.
GREGORY
No, marry; I fear thee!
SAMPSON
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
GREGORY
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
they list.
SAMPSON
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

ABRAHAM
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON
I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABRAHAM
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
ay?
GREGORY
No.
SAMPSON
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.
GREGORY
Do you quarrel, sir?
ABRAHAM
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
SAMPSON
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
ABRAHAM
No better.
SAMPSON
Well, sir.
GREGORY
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
SAMPSON
Yes, better, sir.
ABRAHAM
You lie.
SAMPSON
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
They fight

Enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
Beats down their swords

Enter TYBALT

TYBALT
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
BENVOLIO
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYBALT
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!
They fight

Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

First Citizen
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

CAPULET
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
LADY CAPULET
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
CAPULET
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

MONTAGUE
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
LADY MONTAGUE
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

PRINCE
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

MONTAGUE
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLIO
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLIO
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BENVOLIO
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLIO
Have you importuned him by any means?
MONTAGUE
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
MONTAGUE
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

BENVOLIO
Good-morrow, cousin.
ROMEO
Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO
But new struck nine.
ROMEO
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLIO
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO
In love?
ROMEO
Out--
BENVOLIO
Of love?
ROMEO
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROMEO
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLIO
No, coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO
Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO
At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
BENVOLIO
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROMEO
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
BENVOLIO
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
ROMEO
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BENVOLIO
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.
ROMEO
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLIO
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
ROMEO
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLIO
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
BENVOLIO
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.
ROMEO
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
BENVOLIO
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A street.
Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
CAPULET
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARIS
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
To Servant, giving a paper

Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

Servant
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

BENVOLIO
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO
For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO
For your broken shin.
BENVOLIO
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
Servant
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
ROMEO
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Servant
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?
ROMEO
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Servant
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
ROMEO
Stay, fellow; I can read.
Reads

'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?
Servant
Up.
ROMEO
Whither?
Servant
To supper; to our house.
ROMEO
Whose house?
Servant
My master's.
ROMEO
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
Servant
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!
Exit

BENVOLIO
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROMEO
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
BENVOLIO
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
ROMEO
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
Nurse
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
Enter JULIET

JULIET
How now! who calls?
Nurse
Your mother.
JULIET
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
LADY CAPULET
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Nurse
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LADY CAPULET
She's not fourteen.
Nurse
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
LADY CAPULET
A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
LADY CAPULET
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Nurse
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
JULIET
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Nurse
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.
LADY CAPULET
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?
JULIET
It is an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
LADY CAPULET
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Nurse
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nurse
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
LADY CAPULET
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.
Nurse
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
LADY CAPULET
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
JULIET
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Enter a Servant

Servant
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
LADY CAPULET
We follow thee.
Exit Servant

Juliet, the county stays.
Nurse
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.
Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
ROMEO
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?
BENVOLIO
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROMEO
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
MERCUTIO
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
ROMEO
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTIO
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTIO
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
BENVOLIO
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.
ROMEO
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
MERCUTIO
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
ROMEO
Nay, that's not so.
MERCUTIO
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.
MERCUTIO
Why, may one ask?
ROMEO
I dream'd a dream to-night.
MERCUTIO
And so did I.
ROMEO
Well, what was yours?
MERCUTIO
That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MERCUTIO
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--
ROMEO
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.
MERCUTIO
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
BENVOLIO
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROMEO
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
BENVOLIO
Strike, drum.
Exeunt

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
First Servant
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
Second Servant
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
First Servant
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!
Second Servant
Ay, boy, ready.
First Servant
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.
Second Servant
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

CAPULET
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
Music plays, and they dance

More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
Second Capulet
By'r lady, thirty years.
CAPULET
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
Second Capulet
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.
CAPULET
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO
[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
Servant
I know not, sir.
ROMEO
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
TYBALT
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET
Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
CAPULET
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.
CAPULET
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
TYBALT
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAPULET
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
Exit

ROMEO
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.
JULIET
You kiss by the book.
Nurse
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO
What is her mother?
Nurse
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
ROMEO
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
BENVOLIO
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
CAPULET
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.
Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

JULIET
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Nurse
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULIET
What's he that now is going out of door?
Nurse
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
JULIET
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
Nurse
I know not.
JULIET
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
Nurse
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.
JULIET
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
Nurse
What's this? what's this?
JULIET
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
One calls within 'Juliet.'

Nurse
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
Exeunt

ACT II
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Chorus
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Exit

SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

BENVOLIO
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
MERCUTIO
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
BENVOLIO
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTIO
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
BENVOLIO
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTIO
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.
BENVOLIO
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
MERCUTIO
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?
BENVOLIO
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
JULIET appears above at a window

But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET
Ay me!
ROMEO
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.
ROMEO
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
ROMEO
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JULIET
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JULIET
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
JULIET
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
JULIET
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO
What shall I swear by?
JULIET
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO
If my heart's dear love--
JULIET
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
JULIET
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
Nurse calls within

I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Exit, above

ROMEO
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Nurse
[Within] Madam!
JULIET
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--
Nurse
[Within] Madam!
JULIET
By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.
ROMEO
So thrive my soul--
JULIET
A thousand times good night!
Exit, above

ROMEO
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Retiring

Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
ROMEO
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!
JULIET
Romeo!
ROMEO
My dear?
JULIET
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO
At the hour of nine.
JULIET
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.
ROMEO
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
JULIET
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROMEO
I would I were thy bird.
JULIET
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Exit above

ROMEO
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
Exit

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
FRIAR LAURENCE
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Enter ROMEO

ROMEO
Good morrow, father.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
ROMEO
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
FRIAR LAURENCE
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
ROMEO
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
ROMEO
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR LAURENCE
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO
And bad'st me bury love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
FRIAR LAURENCE
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
ROMEO
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
MERCUTIO
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?
BENVOLIO
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLIO
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MERCUTIO
A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLIO
Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTIO
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLIO
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLIO
Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!
BENVOLIO
The what?
MERCUTIO
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!
Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
MERCUTIO
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.
ROMEO
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
ROMEO
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.
ROMEO
Meaning, to court'sy.
MERCUTIO
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO
A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO
Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO
Right.
ROMEO
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
MERCUTIO
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
ROMEO
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.
MERCUTIO
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
ROMEO
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
MERCUTIO
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.
MERCUTIO
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO
Nay, good goose, bite not.
MERCUTIO
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.
ROMEO
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTIO
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!
ROMEO
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
MERCUTIO
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
BENVOLIO
Stop there, stop there.
MERCUTIO
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLIO
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTIO
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
ROMEO
Here's goodly gear!
Enter Nurse and PETER

MERCUTIO
A sail, a sail!
BENVOLIO
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
Nurse
Peter!
PETER
Anon!
Nurse
My fan, Peter.
MERCUTIO
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.
Nurse
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MERCUTIO
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
Nurse
Is it good den?
MERCUTIO
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.
Nurse
Out upon you! what a man are you!
ROMEO
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.
Nurse
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?
ROMEO
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
Nurse
You say well.
MERCUTIO
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.
Nurse
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.
BENVOLIO
She will indite him to some supper.
MERCUTIO
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
ROMEO
What hast thou found?
MERCUTIO
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
Sings

An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.
ROMEO
I will follow you.
MERCUTIO
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Singing

'lady, lady, lady.'
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

Nurse
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
ROMEO
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.
Nurse
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
PETER
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.
Nurse
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
ROMEO
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--
Nurse
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
ROMEO
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
Nurse
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
ROMEO
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
Nurse
No truly sir; not a penny.
ROMEO
Go to; I say you shall.
Nurse
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
ROMEO
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Nurse
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
ROMEO
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
Nurse
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROMEO
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
NURSE
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
ROMEO
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
Nurse
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.
ROMEO
Commend me to thy lady.
Nurse
Ay, a thousand times.
Exit Romeo

Peter!
PETER
Anon!
Nurse
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
Enter JULIET
JULIET
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
Enter Nurse and PETER

O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Nurse
Peter, stay at the gate.
Exit PETER

JULIET
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Nurse
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
JULIET
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
Nurse
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JULIET
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Nurse
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
JULIET
No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Nurse
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
JULIET
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Nurse
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
JULIET
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'
Nurse
O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JULIET
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Nurse
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JULIET
I have.
Nurse
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
JULIET
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
FRIAR LAURENCE
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
ROMEO
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Enter JULIET

Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
JULIET
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JULIET
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROMEO
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JULIET
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A public place.
Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
BENVOLIO
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTIO
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO
Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLIO
And what to?
MERCUTIO
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
BENVOLIO
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MERCUTIO
The fee-simple! O simple!
BENVOLIO
By my head, here come the Capulets.
MERCUTIO
By my heel, I care not.
Enter TYBALT and others

TYBALT
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
MERCUTIO
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.
TYBALT
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
MERCUTIO
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
BENVOLIO
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Enter ROMEO

TYBALT
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
MERCUTIO
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
TYBALT
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
ROMEO
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
TYBALT
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO
I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
MERCUTIO
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Draws

Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
TYBALT
What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.
TYBALT
I am for you.
Drawing

ROMEO
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MERCUTIO
Come, sir, your passado.
They fight

ROMEO
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

MERCUTIO
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
BENVOLIO
What, art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Exit Page

ROMEO
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
MERCUTIO
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.
ROMEO
I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

ROMEO
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
Re-enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROMEO
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.
BENVOLIO
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Re-enter TYBALT

Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
TYBALT
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
ROMEO
This shall determine that.
They fight; TYBALT falls

BENVOLIO
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
ROMEO
O, I am fortune's fool!
BENVOLIO
Why dost thou stay?
Exit ROMEO

Enter Citizens, & c

First Citizen
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
BENVOLIO
There lies that Tybalt.
First Citizen
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

PRINCE
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLIO
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
LADY CAPULET
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!
PRINCE
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLIO
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
PRINCE
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
PRINCE
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
Enter JULIET
JULIET
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Enter Nurse, with cords

Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Nurse
Ay, ay, the cords.
Throws them down

JULIET
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Nurse
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
JULIET
Can heaven be so envious?
Nurse
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
JULIET
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Nurse
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
JULIET
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
Nurse
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
JULIET
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?
Nurse
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JULIET
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Nurse
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
JULIET
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
Nurse
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!
JULIET
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Nurse
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JULIET
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
JULIET
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
Nurse
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
JULIET
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.
Enter ROMEO

ROMEO
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?
FRIAR LAURENCE
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
ROMEO
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
FRIAR LAURENCE
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
ROMEO
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
FRIAR LAURENCE
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR LAURENCE
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
ROMEO
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
FRIAR LAURENCE
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
ROMEO
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRIAR LAURENCE
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROMEO
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
FRIAR LAURENCE
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
ROMEO
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRIAR LAURENCE
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROMEO
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Knocking within

FRIAR LAURENCE
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROMEO
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
Knocking

FRIAR LAURENCE
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Knocking

Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
Knocking

Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Nurse
[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
my errand;
I come from Lady Juliet.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Welcome, then.
Enter Nurse

Nurse
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Nurse
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROMEO
Nurse!
Nurse
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
ROMEO
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
Nurse
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.
ROMEO
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
Drawing his sword

FRIAR LAURENCE
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.
Nurse
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
ROMEO
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Nurse
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
Exit

ROMEO
How well my comfort is revived by this!
FRIAR LAURENCE
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
ROMEO
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
CAPULET
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
PARIS
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
LADY CAPULET
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
CAPULET
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?
PARIS
Monday, my lord,
CAPULET
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
PARIS
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
CAPULET
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
JULIET
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
ROMEO
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
ROMEO
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
JULIET
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
ROMEO
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
Enter Nurse, to the chamber

Nurse
Madam!
JULIET
Nurse?
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
Exit

JULIET
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
ROMEO
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
He goeth down

JULIET
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULIET
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
ROMEO
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Exit

JULIET
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.
LADY CAPULET
[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
JULIET
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET
Why, how now, Juliet!
JULIET
Madam, I am not well.
LADY CAPULET
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULIET
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.
JULIET
Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
JULIET
What villain madam?
LADY CAPULET
That same villain, Romeo.
JULIET
[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
JULIET
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
LADY CAPULET
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
JULIET
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
LADY CAPULET
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULIET
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
LADY CAPULET
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
JULIET
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
LADY CAPULET
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
LADY CAPULET
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.
Enter CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
LADY CAPULET
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
CAPULET
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
JULIET
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
CAPULET
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!
LADY CAPULET
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
JULIET
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!
Nurse
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
CAPULET
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
Nurse
I speak no treason.
CAPULET
O, God ye god-den.
Nurse
May not one speak?
CAPULET
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.
LADY CAPULET
You are too hot.
CAPULET
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
Exit

JULIET
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
LADY CAPULET
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Exit

JULIET
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.
Nurse
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.
JULIET
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Nurse
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.
JULIET
Amen!
Nurse
What?
JULIET
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.
Nurse
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Exit

JULIET
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
FRIAR LAURENCE
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
PARIS
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
PARIS
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
Enter JULIET

PARIS
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
JULIET
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
PARIS
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
JULIET
What must be shall be.
FRIAR LAURENCE
That's a certain text.
PARIS
Come you to make confession to this father?
JULIET
To answer that, I should confess to you.
PARIS
Do not deny to him that you love me.
JULIET
I will confess to you that I love him.
PARIS
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
JULIET
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
PARIS
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
JULIET
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.
PARIS
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
JULIET
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
PARIS
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
JULIET
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
FRIAR LAURENCE
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
PARIS
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Exit

JULIET
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
FRIAR LAURENCE
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.
JULIET
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
JULIET
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
JULIET
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
FRIAR LAURENCE
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!
Exeunt

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
CAPULET
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Exit First Servant

Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Second Servant
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.
CAPULET
How canst thou try them so?
Second Servant
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET
Go, be gone.
Exit Second Servant

We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Nurse
Ay, forsooth.
CAPULET
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
Nurse
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Enter JULIET

CAPULET
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
JULIET
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
CAPULET
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
JULIET
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.
JULIET
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
LADY CAPULET
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
CAPULET
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.
CAPULET
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
Enter JULIET and Nurse
JULIET
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
JULIET
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET
Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

JULIET
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
Laying down her dagger

What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Nurse
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Enter CAPULET

CAPULET
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.
Nurse
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.
CAPULET
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
LADY CAPULET
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets

Now, fellow,
What's there?
First Servant
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
CAPULET
Make haste, make haste.
Exit First Servant

Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
Second Servant
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
Exit

CAPULET
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Music within

Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Re-enter Nurse

Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
Enter Nurse
Nurse
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Undraws the curtains

What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET
What noise is here?
Nurse
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET
What is the matter?
Nurse
Look, look! O heavy day!
LADY CAPULET
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.
Enter CAPULET

CAPULET
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Nurse
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
LADY CAPULET
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
CAPULET
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Nurse
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET
O woful time!
CAPULET
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

FRIAR LAURENCE
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
CAPULET
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
PARIS
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LADY CAPULET
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
Nurse
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!
PARIS
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
CAPULET
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
CAPULET
All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.
Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

First Musician
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
Nurse
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
Exit

First Musician
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Enter PETER

PETER
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
First Musician
Why 'Heart's ease?'
PETER
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me.
First Musician
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
PETER
You will not, then?
First Musician
No.
PETER
I will then give it you soundly.
First Musician
What will you give us?
PETER
No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
I will give you the minstrel.
First Musician
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
PETER
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?
First Musician
An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Second Musician
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
PETER
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
Musician
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
PETER
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
Second Musician
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
PETER
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
Third Musician
Faith, I know not what to say.
PETER
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'
Exit

First Musician
What a pestilent knave is this same!
Second Musician
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
Enter BALTHASAR, booted

News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
BALTHASAR
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
BALTHASAR
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.
ROMEO
Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
BALTHASAR
No, my good lord.
ROMEO
No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Exit BALTHASAR

Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!
Enter Apothecary

Apothecary
Who calls so loud?
ROMEO
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Apothecary
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Apothecary
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
ROMEO
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Apothecary
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
ROMEO
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR JOHN
FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR JOHN
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
FRIAR JOHN
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
FRIAR JOHN
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
Exit

FRIAR LAURENCE
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Exit

SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
PARIS
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
PAGE
[Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Retires

PARIS
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Page whistles

The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
Retires

Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

ROMEO
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
BALTHASAR
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
ROMEO
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
BALTHASAR
[Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
Retires

ROMEO
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
Opens the tomb

PARIS
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Comes forward

Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
ROMEO
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
PARIS
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
ROMEO
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
They fight

PAGE
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
Exit

PARIS
O, I am slain!
Falls

If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Dies

ROMEO
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
Laying PARIS in the tomb

How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
Drinks

O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Dies

Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

FRIAR LAURENCE
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
BALTHASAR
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.
BALTHASAR
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Who is it?
BALTHASAR
Romeo.
FRIAR LAURENCE
How long hath he been there?
BALTHASAR
Full half an hour.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Go with me to the vault.
BALTHASAR
I dare not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
BALTHASAR
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.
FRIAR LAURENCE
Romeo!
Advances

Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Enters the tomb

Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.
JULIET wakes

JULIET
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Noise within

FRIAR LAURENCE
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
Noise again

I dare no longer stay.
JULIET
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE

What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Kisses him

Thy lips are warm.
First Watchman
[Within] Lead, boy: which way?
JULIET
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
Snatching ROMEO's dagger

This is thy sheath;
Stabs herself

there rust, and let me die.
Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

PAGE
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
First Watchman
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

Second Watchman
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
First Watchman
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

Third Watchman
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
First Watchman
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

PRINCE
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

CAPULET
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
LADY CAPULET
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.
PRINCE
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
First Watchman
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.
PRINCE
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
First Watchman
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.
CAPULET
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
LADY CAPULET
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Enter MONTAGUE and others

PRINCE
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
MONTAGUE
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?
PRINCE
Look, and thou shalt see.
MONTAGUE
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?
PRINCE
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRIAR LAURENCE
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.
PRINCE
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRIAR LAURENCE
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.
PRINCE
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
BALTHASAR
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.
PRINCE
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
PAGE
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
PRINCE
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
CAPULET
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.
MONTAGUE
But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
CAPULET
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
PRINCE
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Exeunt


And so it was I entered the broken world
To trace the visionary company of love, its voice
An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)
But not for long to hold each desperate choice
"The Broken Tower" by Hart Crane
SCENE ONE
The exterior of a two-story corner building on a street in New Orleans which is named Elysian
Fields and runs between the L & N tracks and the river. The section is poor but, unlike
corresponding sections in other American cities, it has a raffish charm. The houses are mostly
white frame, weathered gray, with rickety outside stairs and galleries and quaintly ornamented
gables. This building contains two flats, upstairs and down. Faded white stairs ascend to the
entrances of both.
It is first dark of an evening early in May. The sky that shows around the dim white building is a
peculiarly tender blue, almost a turquoise, which invests the scene with a kind of lyricism and
gracefully attenuates the atmosphere of decay. You can almost feel the warm breath of the brown
river beyond the river warehouses with their faint redolences of bananas and coffee. A
corresponding air is evoked by the music of Negro entertainers at a barroom around the corner.
In this part of New Orleans you are practically always just around the corner, or a few doors
down the street, from a tinny piano being played with the infatuated fluency of brown fingers.
This "Blue Piano" expresses the spirit of the life which goes on here.
Two women, one white and one colored, are taking the air on the steps of the building. The white
woman is Eunice, who occupies the upstairs flat; the colored woman a neighbor, for New
Orleans is a cosmopolitan city where there is a relatively warm and easy intermingling of races
in the old part of town.
Above the music of the "Blue Piano" the voices of people on the street can be heard overlapping.
[Two men come around the corner, Stanley Kowalski and Mitch. They are about twenty-eight or
thirty years old, roughly dressed in blue denim work clothes. Stanley carries his bowling jacket
and a red-stained package from a butcher's. They stop at the foot of the steps.]
STANLEY [bellowing]:
Hey, there! Stella, Baby!
[Stella comes out on the first floor landing, a gentle young woman, about twenty-five, and of a
background obviously quite different from her husband's.]
STELLA [mildly]:
Don't holler at me like that. Hi, Mitch.
STANLEY:
Catch!
STELLA:
What?
STANLEY:
Meat!
[Be heaves the package at her. She cries out in protest but manages to catch it; then she laughes
breathlessly. Her husband and his companion have already started back around the comer.]
STELLA [calling after him]:
Stanley! Where are you going?
STANLEY:
Bowling!
STELLA:
Can I come watch?
STANLEY:
Come on.
[He goes out.]
STELLA:
Be over soon.
[To the white woman]
Hello, Eunice. How are you?
EUNICE:
I'm all right. Tell Steve to get him a poor boy's sandwich 'cause nothing's left here.
[They all laugh; the colored woman does not stop. Stella goes out.]
COLORED WOMAN:
What was that package he th'ew at 'er?
[She rises from steps, laughing louder.]
EUNICE:
You hush, now!
NEGRO WOMAN:
Catch what!
[She continues to laugh. Blanche comes around the corner, currying a valise. She looks at a slip
of paper, then at the building, then again at the slip and again at the building. Her expression is
one of shocked disbelief. Her appearance is incongruous to this setting. She is daintily dressed in
a white suit with a fluffy bodice, necklace and earrings of pearl, white gloves and hat, looking as
if she were arriving at a summer tea or cocktail party in the garden district. She is about five
years older than Stella. Her delicate beauty must avoid a strong light. There is something about
her uncertain manner, as well as her white clothes, that suggests a moth.]
EUNICE [finally]:
What's the matter, honey? Are you lost?
BLANCHE [with faintly hysterical humor]:
They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and
ride six blocks and get off at--Elysian Fields!
EUNICE:
That's where you are now.
BLANCHE:
At Elysian Fields?
EUNICE:
This here is Elysian Fields.
BLANCHE:
They mustn't have understood what number I wanted.
EUNICE:
What number you lookin' for?
[Blanche wearily refers to the slip of paper.]
BLANCHE:
Six thirty-two.
EUNICE:
You don't have to look no further.
BLANCHE [uncomprehendingly]:
I'm looking for my sister, Stella DuBois. I mean--Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.
EUNICE:
That's the party.--You just did miss her, though.
BLANCHE:
This--can this be--her home?
EUNICE:
She's got the downstairs here and I got the up.
BLANCHE:
Oh. She's--out?
EUNICE:
You noticed that bowling alley around the corner?
BLANCHE:
I'm--not sure I did.
EUNICE:
Well, that's where she's at, watchin' her husband bowl.
[There is a pause]
You want to leave your suitcase here an' go find her?
BLANCHE:
No.
NEGRO WOMAN:
I'll go tell her you come.
BLANCHE:
Thanks.
NEGRO WOMAN:
You welcome.
[She goes out.]
EUNICE:
She wasn't expecting you?
BLANCHE:
No. No, not tonight.
EUNICE:
Well, why don't you just go in and make yourself at home till they get back.
BLANCHE:
How could I--do that?
EUNICE:
We own this place so I can let you in.
[She gets up and opens the downstairs door. A light goes on behind the blind, turning it light
blue. Blanche slowly follows her into the downstairs flat. The surrounding areas dim out as the
interior is lighted.]
[Two rooms can be seen, not too clearly defined. The one first entered is primarily a kitchen but
contains a folding bed to be used by Blanche. The room beyond this is a bedroom. Off this room
is a narrow door to a bathroom.]
EUNICE [defensively, noticing Blanche's look]:
It's sort of messed up right now but when it's clean it's real sweet.
BLANCHE:
Is it?
EUNICE:
Uh, huh, I think so. So you're Stella's sister?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
[Wanting to get rid of her]
Thanks for letting me in.
EUNICE:
Por nada, as the Mexicans say, por nada! Stella spoke of you.
BLANCHE:
Yes?
EUNICE:
I think she said you taught school.
BLANCHE:
Yes.
EUNICE:
And you're from Mississippi, huh?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
EUNICE:
She showed me a picture of your home-place, the plantation.
BLANCHE:
Belle Reve?
EUNICE:
A great big place with white columns.
BLANCHE:
Yes...
EUNICE:
A place like that must be awful hard to keep up.
BLANCHE:
If you will excuse me. I'm just about to drop.
EUNICE:
Sure, honey. Why don't you set down?
BLANCHE:
What I meant was I'd like to be left alone.
EUNICE:
Aw. I'll make myself scarce, in that case.
BLANCHE:
I didn't mean to be rude, but--
EUNICE:
I'll drop by the bowling alley an' hustle her up.
[She goes out the door.]
[Blanche sits in a chair very stiffly with her shoulders slightly hunched and her legs pressed close
together and her hands tightly clutching her purse as if she were quite cold. After a while the
blind look goes out of her eyes and she begins to look slowly around. A cat screeches. She
catches her breath with a startled gesture. Suddenly she notices something in a half-opened
closet. She springs up and crosses to it, and removes a whiskey bottle. She pours a half tumbler
of whiskey and tosses it down. She carefully replaces the bottle and washes out the tumbler at the
sink. Then she resumes her seat in front of the table.]
BLANCHE [faintly to herself]:
I've got to keep hold of myself!
[Stella comes quickly around the corner of the building and runs to the door of the downstairs
flat.]
STELLA [calling out joyfully]:
Blanche!
[For a moment they stare at each other. Then Blanche springs up and runs to her with a wild cry.]
BLANCHE:
Stella, oh, Stella, Stella! Stella for Star!
[She begins to speak with feverish vivacity as if she feared for either of them to stop and think.
They catch each other in a spasmodic embrace.]
BLANCHE:
Now, then, let me look at you. But don't you look at me, Stella, no, no, no, not till later, not till
I've bathed and rested! And turn that over-light off! Turn that off! I won't be looked at in this
merciless glare!
[Stella laughs and complies]
Come back here now! Oh, my baby! Stella! Stella for Star!
[She embraces her again]
I thought you would never come back to this horrible place! What am I saying? I didn't mean to
say that. I meant to be nice about it and say--Oh, what a convenient location and such--Haa-ha!
Precious lamb! You haven't said a word to me.
STELLA:
You haven't given me a chance to, honey!
[She laughs, but her glance at Blanche is a little anxious.]
BLANCHE:
Well, now you talk. Open your pretty mouth and talk while I look around for some liquor! I
know you must have some liquor on the place! Where could it be, I wonder? Oh, I spy, I spy!
[She rushes to the closet and removes the bottle; she is shaking all over and panting for breath as
she tries to laugh. The bottle nearly slips from her grasp.]
STELLA [noticing]:
Blanche, you sit down and let me pour the drinks. I don't know what we've got to mix with.
Maybe a coke's in the icebox. Look'n see, honey, while I'm--
BLANCHE:
No coke, honey, not with my nerves tonight! Where--where--where is--?
STELLA:
Stanley? Bowling! He loves it. They're having a--found some soda!--tournament...
BLANCHE:
Just water, baby, to chase it! Now don't get worried, your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard,
she's just all shaken up and hot and tired and dirty! You sit down, now, and explain this place to
me! What are you doing in a place like this?
STELLA:
Now, Blanche--
BLANCHE:
Oh, I'm not going to be hypocritical, I'm going to be honestly critical about it! Never, never,
never in my worst dreams could I picture--Only Poe! Only Mr. Edgar Allan Poe!--could do it
justice! Out there I suppose is the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir!
[She laughs.]
STELLA:
No, honey, those are the L & N tracks.
BLANCHE:
No, now seriously, putting joking aside. Why didn't you tell me, why didn't you write me, honey,
why didn't you let me know?
STELLA [carefully, pouring herself a drink]:
Tell you what, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Why, that you had to live in these conditions!
STELLA:
Aren't you being a little intense about it? It's not that bad at all! New Orleans isn't like other
cities.
BLANCHE:
This has got nothing to do with New Orleans. You might as well say--forgive me, blessed baby!
[She suddenly stops short]
The subject is closed!
STELLA [a little drily]:
Thanks.
[During the pause, Blanche stares at her. She smiles at Blanche.]
BLANCHE [looking down at her glass, which shakes in her hand]:
You're all I've got in the world, and you're not glad to see me!
STELLA [sincerely]:
Why, Blanche, you know that's not true.
BLANCHE:
No?--I'd forgotten how quiet you were.
STELLA:
You never did give me a chance to say much, Blanche. So I just got in the habit of being quiet
around you.
BLANCHE [vaguely]:
A good habit to get into...
[then, abruptly]
You haven't asked me how I happened to get away from the school before the spring term ended.
STELLA:
Well, I thought you'd volunteer that information--if you wanted to tell me.
BLANCHE:
You thought I'd been fired?
STELLA:
No, I--thought you might have--resigned...
BLANCHE:
I was so exhausted by all I'd been through my--nerves broke.
[Nervously tamping cigarette]
I was on the verge of--lunacy, almost! So Mr. Graves--Mr. Graves is the high school
superintendent--he suggested I take a leave of absence. I couldn't put all of those details into the
wire...
[She drinks quickly]
Oh, this buzzes right through me and feels so good!
STELLA:
Won't you have another?
BLANCHE:
No, one's my limit.
STELLA:
Sure?
BLANCHE:
You haven't said a word about my appearance.
STELLA:
You look just fine.
BLANCHE:
God love you for a liar! Daylight never exposed so total a ruin! But you--you've put on some
weight, yes, you're just as plump as a little partridge! And it's so becoming to you!
STELLA:
Now, Blanche--
BLANCHE:
Yes, it is, it is or I wouldn't say it! You just have to watch around the hips a little. Stand up.
STELLA:
Not now.
BLANCHE:
You hear me? I said stand up!
[Stella complies reluctantly]
You messy child, you, you've spilt something on the pretty white lace collar! About your hair--
you ought to have it cut in a feather bob with your dainty features. Stella, you have a maid, don't
you?
STELLA:
No. With only two rooms it's--
BLANCHE:
What? Two rooms, did you say?
STELLA:
This one and--
[She is embarrassed.]
BLANCHE:
The other one?
[She laughs sharply. There is an embarrassed silence.]
BLANCHE:
I am going to take just one little tiny nip more, sort of to put the stopper on, so to speak.... Then
put the bottle away so I won't be tempted.
[She rises]
I want you to look at my figure!
[She turns around]
You know I haven't put on one ounce in ten years, Stella? I weigh what I weighed the summer
you left Belle Reve. The summer Dad died and you left us....
STELLA [a little wearily]:
It's just incredible, Blanche, how well you're looking.
BLANCHE:
[They both laugh uncomfortably]
But, Stella, there's only two rooms, I don't see where you're going to put me!
STELLA:
We're going to put you in here.
BLANCHE:
What kind of bed's this--one of those collapsible things?
[She sits on it.]
STELLA:
Does it feel all right?
BLANCHE [dubiously]:
Wonderful, honey. I don't like a bed that gives much. But there's no door between the two rooms,
and Stanley--will it be decent?
STELLA:
Stanley is Polish, you know.
BLANCHE:
Oh, yes. They're something like Irish, aren't they?
STELLA:
Well--
BLANCHE:
Only not so--highbrow?
[They both laugh again in the same way.]
I brought some nice clothes to meet all your lovely friends in.
STELLA:
I'm afraid you won't think they are lovely.
BLANCHE:
What are they like?
STELLA:
They're Stanley's friends.
BLANCHE:
Polacks?
STELLA:
They're a mixed lot, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
Heterogeneous--types?
STELLA:
Oh, yes. Yes, types is right!
BLANCHE:
Well--anyhow--I brought nice clothes and I'll wear them. I guess you're hoping I'll say I'll put up
at a hotel, but I'm not going to put up at a hotel. I want to be near you, got to be with somebody, I
can't be alone! Because--as you must have noticed--I'm-not very well....
[Her voice drops and her look is frightened.]
STELLA:
You seem a little bit nervous or overwrought or something.
BLANCHE:
Will Stanley like me, or will I just be a visiting in-law, Stella? I couldn't stand that
STELLA:
You'll get along fine together, if you'll just try not to--well--compare him with men that we went
out with at home.
BLANCHE:
Is he so--different?
STELLA:
Yes. A different species.
BLANCHE:
In what way; what's he like?
STELLA:
Oh, you can't describe someone you're in love with! Here's a picture of him!
[She hands a photograph to Blanche.]
BLANCHE:
An officer?
STELLA:
A Master Sergeant in the Engineers' Corps. Those are decorations!
BLANCHE:
He had those on when you met him?
STELLA:
I assure you I wasn't just blinded by all the brass.
BLANCHE:
That's not what I--
STELLA:
But of course there were things to adjust myself to later on.
BLANCHE:
Such as his civilian background!
[Stella laughs uncertainly]
How did he take it when you said I was coming?
STELLA:
Oh, Stanley doesn't know yet.
BLANCHE [frightened]:
You--haven't told him?
STELLA:
He's on the road a good deal.
BLANCHE:
Oh. Travels?
STELLA:
Yes.
BLANCHE:
Good. I mean--isn't it?
STELLA [half to herself]:
I can hardly stand it when he is away for a night...
BLANCHE:
Why, Stella!
STELLA:
When he's away for a week I nearly go wild!
BLANCHE:
Gracious!
STELLA:
And when he comes back I cry on his lap like a baby...
[She smiles to herself.]
BLANCHE:
I guess that is what is meant by being in love....
[Stella looks up with a radiant smile.]
Stella--
STELLA:
What?
BLANCHE [in an uneasy rush]:
I haven't asked you the things you probably thought I was going to ask. And so I'll expect you to
be understanding about what I have to tell you.
STELLA:
What, Blanche?
[Her face turns anxious.]
BLANCHE:
Well, Stella--you're going to reproach me, I know that you're bound to reproach me--but before
you do--take into consideration--you left! I stayed and struggled! You came to New Orleans and
looked out for yourself. I stayed at Belle Reve and tried to hold it together! I'm not meaning this
in any reproachful way, but all the burden descended on my shoulders.
STELLA:
The best I could do was make my own living, Blanche.
[Blanche begins to shake again with intensity.]
BLANCHE:
I know, I know. But you are the one that abandoned Belle Reve, not I! I stayed and fought for it,
bled for it, almost died for it!
STELLA:
Stop this hysterical outburst and tell me what's happened! What do you mean fought and bled?
What kind of--
BLANCHE:
I knew you would, Stella. I knew you would take this attitude about it!
STELLA:
About--what?--please!
BLANCHE [slowly]:
The loss--the loss...
STELLA:
Belle Reve? Lost, is it? No!
BLANCHE:
Yes, Stella.
[They stare at each other across the yellow-checked linoleum of the table. Blanche slowly nods
her head and Stella looks slowly down at her hands folded on the table. The music of the "blue
piano" grows louder. Blanche touches her handkerchief to her forehead.]
STELLA:
But how did it go? What happened?
BLANCHE [springing up]:
You're a fine one to ask me how it went!
STELLA:
Blanche!
BLANCHE:
You're a fine one to sit there accusing me of it!
STELLA:
Blanche!
BLANCHE:
I, I, I took the blows in my face and my body! All of those deaths! The long parade to the
graveyard! Father, mother! Margaret, that dreadful way! So big with it, it couldn't be put in a
coffin! But had to be burned like rubbish! You just came home in time for the funerals, Stella.
And funerals are pretty compared to deaths. Funerals are quiet, but deaths--not always.
Sometimes their breathing is hoarse, and sometimes it rattles, and sometimes they even cry out to
you, "Don't let me go!" Even the old, sometimes, say, "Don't let me go." As if you were able to
stop them! But funerals are quiet, with pretty flowers. And, oh, what gorgeous boxes they pack
them away in! Unless you were there at the bed when they cried out, "Hold me!" you'd never
suspect there was the struggle for breath and bleeding. You didn't dream, but I saw! Saw! Saw!
And now you sit there telling me with your eyes that I let the place go! How in hell do you think
all that sickness and dying was paid for? Death is expensive, Miss Stella! And old Cousin
Jessie's right after Margaret's, hers! Why, the Grim Reaper had put up his tent on our doorstep!...
Stella. Belle Reve was his headquarters! Honey--that's how it slipped through my fingers! Which
of them left us a fortune? Which of them left a cent of insurance even? Only poor Jessie--one
hundred to pay for her coffin. That was all, Stella! And I with my pitiful salary at the school.
Yes, accuse me! Sit there and stare at me, thinking I let the place go! I let the place go? Where
were you! In bed with your--Polack!
STELLA [springing]:
Blanche! You be still! That's enough!
[She starts out.]
BLANCHE:
Where are you going?
STELLA:
I'm going into the bathroom to wash my face.
BLANCHE:
Oh, Stella, Stella, you're crying!
STELLA:
Does that surprise you?
BLANCHE:
Forgive me--I didn't mean to--
[The sound of men's voices is heard. Stella goes into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.
When the men appear, and Blanche realizes it must be Stanley returning, she moves uncertainly
from the bathroom door to the dressing table, looking apprehensively toward the front door.
Stanley enters, followed by Steve and Mitch. Stanley pauses near his door, Steve by the foot of
the spiral stair, and Mitch is slightly above and to the right of them, about to go out. As the men
enter, we hear some of the following dialogue.]
STANLEY:
Is that how he got it?
STEVE:
Sure that's how he got it. He hit the old weather-bird for 300 bucks on a six-number-ticket.
MITCH:
Don't tell him those things; he'll believe it.
[Mitch starts out.]
STANLEY [restraining Mitch]:
Hey, Mitch-come back here.
[Blanche, at the sound of voices, retires in the bedroom. She picks up Stanley's photo from
dressing table, looks at it, puts it down. When Stanley enters the apartment, she darts and hides
behind the screen at the head of bed.]
STEVE [to Stanley and Mitch]:
Hey, are we playin' poker tomorrow?
STANLEY:
Sure--at Mitch's.
MITCH [hearing this, returns quickly to the stair rail]:
No--not at my place. My mother's still sick!
STANLEY:
Okay, at my place....
[Mitch starts out again]
But you bring the beer!
[Mitch pretends not to hear,--calls out "Goodnight all," and goes out, singing.]
Eunice's voice is heard, above:
Break it up down there! I made the spaghetti dish and ate it myself.
STEVE [going upstairs]:
I told you and phoned you we was playing.
[To the men] Jax beer!
EUNICE:
You never phoned me once.
STEVE:
I told you at breakfast--and phoned you at lunch....
EUNICE:
Well, never mind about that. You just get yourself home here once in a while.
STEVE:
You want it in the papers?
[More laughter and shouts of parting come from the men. Stanley throws the screen door of the
kitchen open and comes in. He is of medium height, about five feet eight or nine, and strongly,
compactly built. Animal joy in his being is implicit in all his movements and attitudes. Since
earliest manhood the center of his life has been pleasure with women, the giving and taking of it,
not with weak indulgence, dependency, but with the power and pride of a richly feathered male
bird among hens. Branching out from this complete and satisfying center are all the auxiliary
channels of his life, such as his heartiness with men, his appreciation of rough humor, his love of
good drink and food and games, his car, his radio, everything that is his, that bears his emblem of
the gaudy seed-bearer. He sizes women up at a glance, with sexual classifications, crude images
flashing into his mind and determining the way he smiles at them.]
BLANCHE [drawing involuntarily back from his stare]:
You must be Stanley. I'm Blanche.
STANLEY:
Stella's sister?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
STANLEY:
H'lo. Where's the little woman?
BLANCHE:
In the bathroom.
STANLEY:
Oh. Didn't know you were coming in town.
BLANCHE:
I--uh--
STANLEY:
Where you from, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Why, I--live in Laurel.
[He has crossed to the closet and removed the whiskey bottle.]
STANLEY:
In Laurel, huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, in Laurel, that's right. Not in my territory. Liquor goes fast in
hot weather.
[He holds the bottle to the light to observe its depletion.]
Have a shot?
BLANCHE:
No, I--rarely touch it.
STANLEY:
Some people rarely touch it, but it touches them often.
BLANCHE [faintly]:
Ha-ha.
STANLEY:
My clothes 're stickin' to me. Do you mind if I make myself comfortable?
[He starts to remove his shirt.]
BLANCHE:
Please, please do.
STANLEY:
Be comfortable is my motto.
BLANCHE:
It's mine, too. It's hard to stay looking fresh. I haven't washed or even powdered my face and--
here you are!
STANLEY:
You know you can catch cold sitting around in damp things, especially when you been
exercising hard like bowling is. You're a teacher, arent you?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
STANLEY:
What do you teach, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
English.
STANLEY:
I never was a very good English student. How long you here for, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
I--don't know yet.
STANLEY:
You going to shack up here?
BLANCHE:
I thought I would if it's not inconvenient for you all.
STANLEY:
Good.
BLANCHE:
Traveling wears me out.
STANLEY:
Well, take it easy.
[A cat screeches near the window. Blanche springs up.]
BLANCHE:
What's that?
STANLEY:
Cats.... Hey, Stella!
STELLA [faintly, from the bathroom]:
Yes, Stanley.
STANLEY:
Haven't fallen in, have you?
[Be grins at Blanche. She tries unsuccessfully to smile back. There is a silence]
I'm afraid I'll strike you as being the unrefined type. Stella's spoke of you a good deal. You were
married once, weren't you?
[The music of the polka rises up, faint in the distance.]
BLANCHE:
Yes. When I was quite young.
STANLEY:
What happened?
BLANCHE:
The boy--the boy died.
[She sinks back down]
I'm afraid I'm-going to be sick!
[Her head falls on her arms.]
SCENE TWO
It is six o'clock the following evening. Blanche is bathing. Stella is completing her toilette.
Blanche's dress, a flowered print, is laid out on Stella's bed. Stanley enters the kitchen from
outside, leaving the door open on the perpetual "blue piano" around the corner.
STANLEY:
What's all this monkey doings?
STELLA:
Oh, Stan!
[She jumps up and kisses him which he accepts with lordly composure]
I'm taking Blanche to Galatoire's for supper and then to a show, because it's your pok'r night
STANLEY:
How about my supper, huh? I'm not going to no Galatoire's for supper!
STELLA:
I put you a cold plate on ice.
STANLEY:
Well, isn't that just dandy!
STELLA:
I'm going to try to keep Blanche out till the party breaks up because I don't know how she would
take it. So we'll go to one of the little places in the Quarter afterwards and you'd better give me
some money.
STANLEY:
Where is she?
STELLA:
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves. She's terribly upset.
STANLEY:
Over what?
STELLA:
She's been through such an ordeal.
STANLEY:
Yeah?
STELLA:
Stan, we've--lost Belle Reve!
STANLEY:
The place in the country?
STELLA:
Yes.
STANLEY:
How?
STELLA [vaguely]:
Oh, it had to be--sacrificed or something.
[There is a pause while Stanley considers. Stella is changing into her dress]
When she comes in be sure to say something nice about her appearance. And, oh! Don't mention
the baby. I haven't said anything yet, I'm waiting until she gets in a quieter condition.
STANLEY [ominously]:
So!
STELLA:
And try to understand her and be nice to her, Stan.
BLANCHE [singing in the bathroom]:
"From the land of the sky blue water, They brought a captive maid!"
STELLA:
She wasn't expecting to find us in such a small place. You see I'd tried to gloss things over a little
in my letters.
STANLEY:
So?
STELLA:
And admire her dress and tell her she's looking wonderful. That's important with Blanche. Her
little weakness!
STANLEY:
Yeah. I get the idea. Now let's skip back a little to where you said the country place was disposed
of.
STELLA:
Oh!--yes...
STANLEY:
How about that? Let's have a few more details on that subject.
STELLA:
It's best not to talk much about it until she's calmed down.
STANLEY:
So that's the deal, huh? Sister Blanche cannot be annoyed with business details right now!
STELLA:
You saw how she was last night.
STANLEY:
Uh-hum, I saw how she was. Now let's have a gander at the bill of sale.
STELLA:
I haven't seen any.
STANLEY:
She didn't show you no papers, no deed of sale or nothing like that, huh?
STELLA:
It seems like it wasn't sold.
STANLEY:
Well what in hell was it then, give away? To charity?
STELLA:
Shhh! She'll hear you.
STANLEY:
I don't care if she hears me. Let's see the papers!
STELLA:
There weren't any papers, she didn't show any papers, I don't care about papers.
STANLEY:
Have you ever heard of the Napoleonic code?
STELLA:
No, Stanley, I haven't heard of the Napoleonic code, if I have, I don't see what it--
STANLEY:
Let me enlighten you on a point or two, baby.
STELLA:
Yes?
STANLEY:
In the state of Louisiana we have the Napoleonic code according to which what belongs to the
wife belongs to the husband and vice versa. For instance if I had a piece of property, or you had a
piece of property--
STELLA:
My head is swimming!
STANLEY:
All right, I'll wait till she gets through soaking in a hot tub and then I'll inquire if she is
acquainted with the Napoleonic code. It looks to me like you have been swindled, baby, and
when you're swindled under the Napoleonic code I'm swindled too. And I don't like to be
swindled.
STELLA:
There's plenty of time to ask her questions later but if you do now she'll go to pieces again. I
don't understand what happened to Belle Reve but you don't know how ridiculous you are being
when you suggest that my sister or I or anyone of our family could have perpetrated a swindle on
anyone else.
STANLEY:
Then where's the money if the place was sold?
STELLA:
Not sold--lost, lost!
[He stalks into bedroom, and she follows him.]
Stanley!
[He pulls open the wardrobe trunk standing in middle of room and jerks out an armful of
dresses.]
STANLEY:
Open your eyes to this stuff! You think she got them out of a teacher's pay?
STELLA:
Hush!
STANLEY:
Look at these feathers and furs that she come here to preen herself in! What's this here? A solidgold dress, I believe! And this one! What is these here? Fox-pieces!
[He blows on them]
Genuine fox fur-pieces, a half a mile long! Where are your fox-pieces, Stella? Bushy snow-white
ones, no less! Where are your white fox-pieces?
STELLA:
Those are inexpensive summer furs that Blanche has had a long time.
STANLEY:
I got an acquaintance who deals in this sort of merchandise. I'll have him in here to appraise it.
I'm willing to bet you there's thousands of dollars invested in this stuff here!
STELLA:
Don't be such an idiot, Stanley!
[He hurls the furs on the daybed. Then he jerks open small drawer in the trunk and pulls up a
fist-full of costume jewellery.]
STANLEY:
And what have we here? The treasure chest of a pirate!
STELLA:
Oh, Stanley!
STANLEY:
Pearls! Ropes of them! What is this sister of yours, a deep-sea diver who brings up sunken
treasure? Or is she the champion safe-cracker of all time! Bracelets of solid gold, too! Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?
STELLA: Shhh ! Be still, Stanley!
STANLEY: And diamonds! A crown for an empress!
STELLA:
A rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball.
STANLEY:
What's rhinestone?
STELLA:
Next door to glass.
STANLEY:
Are you kidding? I have an acquaintance that works in a jewellery store. I'll have him in here to
make an appraisal of this. Here's your plantation, or what was left of it, here!
STELLA:
You have no idea how stupid and horrid you're being! Now close that trunk before she comes out
of the bathroom!
[He kicks the trunk partly closed and sits on the kitchen table.]
STANLEY:
The Kowalskis and the DuBois have different notions.
STELLA [angrily]:
Indeed they have, thank heavens!--I'm going outside.
[She snatches up her white hat and gloves and crosses to the outside door.]
You come out with me while Blanche is getting dressed.
STANLEY:
Since when do you give me orders?
STELLA:
Are you going to stay here and insult her?
STANLEY:
You're damn tootin' I'm going to stay here.
[Stella goes out to the porch. Blanche comes out of the bathroom in a red satin robe.]
BLANCHE [airily]:
Hello, Stanley! Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented, and feeling like a brand new human
being!
[He lights a cigarette.]
STANLEY:
That's good.
BLANCHE [drawing the curtains at the windows]:
Excuse me while I slip on my pretty new dress!
STANLEY:
Go right ahead, Blanche.
[She closes the drapes between the rooms.]
BLANCHE:
I understand there's to be a little card party to which we ladies are cordially not invited!
STANLEY [ominously]:
Yeah?
[Blanche throws off her robe and slips into a flowered print dress.]
BLANCHE:
Where's Stella?
STANLEY:
Out on the porch.
BLANCHE:
I'm going to ask a favor of you in a moment.
STANLEY:
What could that be, I wonder?
BLANCHE:
Some buttons in back! You may enter!
[He crosses through drapes with a smoldering look.]
How do I look?
STANLEY:
You look all right.
BLANCHE:
Many thanks! Now the buttons!
STANLEY:
I can't do nothing with them.
BLANCHE:
You men with your big clumsy fingers. May I have a drag on your cig?
STANLEY:
Have one for yourself.
BLANCHE:
Why, thanks!... It looks like my trunk has exploded.
STANLEY:
Me an' Stella were helping you unpack.
BLANCHE:
Well, you certainly did a fast and thorough job of it!
STANLEY:
It looks like you raided some stylish shops in Paris.
BLANCHE:
Ha-ha! Yes--clothes are my passion!
STANLEY:
What does it cost for a string of fur-pieces like that?
BLANCHE:
Why, those were a tribute from an admirer of mine!
STANLEY:
He must have had a lot of--admiration!
BLANCHE:
Oh, in my youth I excited some admiration. But look at me now!
[She smiles at him radiantly]
Would you think it possible that I was once considered to be--attractive?
STANLEY:
Your looks are okay.
BLANCHE:
I was fishing for a compliment, Stanley.
STANLEY:
I don't go in for that stuff.
BLANCHE:
What--stuff?
STANLEY:
Compliments to women about their looks. I never met a woman that didn't know if she was
good-looking or not without being told, and some of them give themselves credit for more than
they've got. I once went out with a doll who said to me, "I am the glamorous type, I am the
glamorous type!" I said, "So what?"
BLANCHE:
And what did she say then?
STANLEY:
She didn't say nothing. That shut her up like a clam.
BLANCHE:
Did it end the romance?
STANLEY:
It ended the conversation--that was all. Some men are took in by this Hollywood glamor stuff
and some men are not.
BLANCHE:
I'm sure you belong in the second category.
STANLEY:
That's right.
BLANCHE:
I cannot imagine any witch of a woman casting a spell over you.
STANLEY:
That's right.
BLANCHE:
You're simple, straightforward and honest, a little bit on the primitive side I should think. To
interest you a woman would have to--
[She pauses with an indefinite gesture.]
STANLEY [slowly]:
Lay... her cards on the table.
BLANCHE [smiling]:
Well, I never cared for wishy-washy people. That was why, when you walked in here last night, I
said to myself--"My sister has married a man!"--Of course that was all that I could tell about you.
STANLEY [booming]:
Now let's cut the re-bop?
BLANCHE [pressing hands to her ears]:
Ouuuuu!
STELLA [calling from the steps]:
Stanley! You come out here and let Blanche finish dressing!
BLANCHE:
I'm through dressing, honey.
STELLA:
Well, you come out, then.
STANLEY:
Your sister and I are having a little talk.
BLANCHE [lightly]:
Honey, do me a favor. Run to the drugstore and get me a lemon-coke with plenty of chipped ice
in it!--Will you do that for me, Sweetie?
STELLA [uncertainly]:
Yes.
[She goes around the corner of the building.]
BLANCHE:
The poor little thing was out there listening to us, and I have an idea she doesn't understand you
as well as I do.... All right; now, Mr. Kowalski, let us proceed without any more double-talk. I'm
ready to answer all questions. I've nothing to hide. What is it?
STANLEY:
There is such a thing in this state of Louisiana as the Napoleonic code, according to which
whatever belongs to my wife is also mine--and vice versa.
BLANCHE:
My, but you have an impressive judicial air!
[She sprays herself with her atomizer; then playfully sprays him with it. He seizes the atomizer
and slams it down on the dresser. She throws back her head and laughs.]
STANLEY:
If I didn't know that you was my wife's sister I'd get ideas about you!
BLANCHE:
Such as what!
STANLEY:
Don't play so dumb. You know what!
BLANCHE [she puts the atomizer on the table]:
All right. Cards on the table. That suits me.
[She turns to Stanley.]
I know I fib a good deal. After all, a woman's charm is fifty percent illusion, but when a thing is
important I tell the truth, and this is the truth:
I haven't cheated my sister or you or anyone else as long as I have lived.
STANLEY:
Where's the papers? In the trunk?
BLANCHE:
Everything that I own is in that trunk.
[Stanley crosses to the trunk, shoves it roughly open and begins to open compartments.]
BLANCHE:
What in the name of heaven are you thinking of! What's in the back of that little boy's mind of
yours? That I am absconding with something, attempting some kind of treachery on my sister?--
Let me do that! It will be faster and simpler....
[She crosses to the trunk and takes out a box]
I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
[She opens it.]
STANLEY:
What's them underneath?
[He indicates another sheaf of papers.
BLANCHE:
These are love-letters, yellowing with antiquity, all from one boy.
[He snatches them up. She speaks fiercely]
Give those back to me!
STANLEY:
I'll have a look at them first!
BLANCHE:
The touch of your hands insults them!
STANLEY:
Don't pull that stuff!
[He rips off the ribbon and starts to examine them. Blanche snatches them from him, and they
cascade to the floor.]
BLANCHE:
Now that you've touched them I'll burn them!
STANLEY [staring, baffled]:
What in hell are they?
BLANCHE [on the floor gathering them up]:
Poems a dead boy wrote. I hurt him the way that you would like to hurt me, but you can't! I'm
not young and vulnerable any more. But my young husband was and I--never mind about that!
Just give them back to me!
STANLEY:
What do you mean by saying you'll have to burn them?
BLANCHE:
I'm sorry, I must have lost my head for a moment. Everyone has something he wont let others
touch because of their--intimate nature....
[She now seems faint with exhaustion and she sits down with the strong box and puts on a pair of
glasses and goes methodically through a large stack of papers.] Ambler & Ambler. Hmmmmm....
Crabtree.... More Ambler & Ambler.
STANLEY:
What is Ambler & Ambler?
BLANCHE:
A firm that made loans on the place.
STANLEY:
Then it was lost on a mortgage?
BLANCHE [touching her forehead]:
That must've been what happened.
STANLEY:
I don't want no ifs, ands or buts! What's all the rest of them papers?
[She hands him the entire box. He carries it to the table and starts to examine the papers.]
BLANCHE [picking up a large envelope containing more papers]:
There are thousands of papers, stretching back over hundreds of years, affecting Belle Reve as,
piece by piece, our improvident grandfathers and father and uncles and brothers exchanged the
land for their epic fornications--to put it plainly!
[She removes her glasses with an exhausted laugh]
The four-letter word deprived us of our plantation, till finally all that was left--and Stella can
verify that!--was the house itself and about twenty acres of ground, including a graveyard, to
which now all but Stella and I have retreated.
[She pours the contents of the envelope on the table]
Here all of them are, all papers! I hereby endow you with them! Take them, peruse them--
commit them to memory, even! I think it's wonderfully fitting that Belle Reve should finally be
this bunch of old papers in your big, capable hands!... I wonder if Stella's come back with my
lemon-coke....
[She leans back and closes her eyes.]
STANLEY:
I have a lawyer acquaintance who will study these out.
BLANCHE:
Present them to him with a box of aspirin tablets.
STANLEY [becoming somewhat sheepish]:
You see, under the Napoleonic code--a man has to take an interest in his wife's affairs--especially
now that she's going to have a baby.
[Blanche opens her eyes. The "blue piano" sounds louder.]
BLANCHE:
Stella? Stella going to have a baby?
[dreamily]
I didn't know she was going to have a baby!
[She gets up and crosses to the outside door. Stella appears around the corner with a carton from
the drugstore.
[Stanley goes into the bedroom with the envelope and the box.
[The inner rooms fade to darkness and the outside wall of the house is visible. Blanche meets
Stella at the foot of the steps to the sidewalk.]
BLANCHE:
Stella, Stella for star! How lovely to have a baby! It's all right. Everything's all right.
STELLA:
I'm sorry he did that to you.
BLANCHE:
Oh, I guess he's just not the type that goes for jasmine perfume, but maybe he's what we need to
mix with our blood now that we've lost Belle Reve. We thrashed it out. I feel a bit shaky, but I
think I handled it nicely, I laughed and treated it all as a joke.
[Steve and Pablo appear, carrying a case of beer.]
I called him a little boy and laughed and flirted. Yes, I was flirting with your husband!
[as the men approach]
The guests are gathering for the poker party.
[The two men pass between them, and enter the house.]
Which way do we go now, Stella--this way?
STELLA:
No, this way.
[She leads Blanche away.]
BLANCHE [laughing]:
The blind are leading the blind!
[A tamale vendor is heard calling.]
VENDOR'S VOICE:
Red-hot!
SCENE THREE
THE POKER NIGHT. There is a picture of Van Gogh's of a billiard-parlor at night. The kitchen
now suggests that sort of lurid nocturnal brilliance, the raw colors of childhood's spectrum. Over
the yellow linoleum of the kitchen table hangs an electric bulb with a vivid green glass shade.
The poker players--Stanley, Steve, Mitch and Pablo--wear colored shirts, solid blues, a purple, a
red-and-white check, a light green, and they are men at the peak of their physical manhood, as
coarse and direct and powerful as the primary colors. There are vivid slices of watermelon on the
table, whiskey bottles and glasses. The bedroom is relatively dim with only the light that spills
between the portieres and through the wide window on the street. For a moment, there is
absorbed silence as a hand is dealt.
STEVE:
Anything wild this deal?
PABLO:
One-eyed jacks are wild.
STEVE:
Give me two cards.
PABLO:
You, Mitch?
MITCH:
I'm out
PABLO:
One.
MITCH:
Anyone want a shot?
STANLEY:
Yeah. Me.
PABLO:
Why don't somebody go to the Chinaman's and bring back a load of chop suey?
STANLEY:
When I'm losing you want to eat! Ante up! Openers? Openers! Get y'r ass off the table, Mitch.
Nothing belongs on a poker table but cards, chips and whiskey.
[He lurches up and tosses some watermelon rinds to the floor.]
MITCH:
Kind of on your high horse, ain't you?
STANLEY:
How many?
STEVE:
Give me three.
STANLEY:
One.
MITCH:
I'm out again. I oughta go home pretty soon.
STANLEY:
Shut up.
MITCH:
I gotta sick mother. She don't go to sleep until I come in at night
STANLEY:
Then why don't you stay home with her?
MITCH:
She says to go out, so I go, but I don't enjoy it. All the while I keep wondering how she is.
STANLEY:
Aw, for the sake of Jesus, go home, then!
PABLO:
What've you got?
STANLEY:
Spade flush.
MITCH:
You all are married. But I'll be alone when she goes.--I'm going to the bathroom.
STANLEY:
Hurry back and well fix you a sugar-tit.
MITCH:
Aw, go rut.
[He crosses through the bedroom into the bathroom.]
STEVE [dealing a hand):
Seven-card stud.
[Telling his joke as he deals]
This ole farmer is out in back of his house sittin' down th'owing corn to the chickens when all at
once he hears a loud cackle and this young hen comes lickety split around the side of the house
with the rooster right behind her and gaining on her fast.
STANLEY [impatient with the story]:
Deal!
STEVE:
But when the rooster catches sight of the farmer th'owing the corn he puts on the brakes and lets
the hen get away and starts pecking corn. And the old farmer says, "Lord God, I hopes I never
gits that hongry!"
[Steve and Pablo laugh. The sisters appear around the corner of the building]
STELLA:
The game is still going on.
BLANCHE:
How do I look?
STELLA:
Lovely, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I feel so hot and frazzled. Wait till I powder before you open the door. Do I look done in?
STELLA:
Why no. You are as fresh as a daisy.
BLANCHE:
One that's been picked a few days.
[Stella opens the door and they enter.]
STELLA:
Well, well, well. I see you boys are still at it!
STANLEY:
Where you been?
STELLA:
Blanche and I took in a show. Blanche, this is Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Hubbell.
BLANCHE:
Please don't get up.
STANLEY:
Nobody's going to get up, so don't be worried.
STELLA:
How much longer is this game going to continue?
STANLEY:
Till we get ready to quit.
BLANCHE:
Poker is so fascinating. Could I kibitz?
STANLEY:
You could not. Why don't you women go up and sit with Eunice?
STELLA:
Because it is nearly two-thirty.
[Blanche crosses into the bedroom and partially closes the portieres]
Couldn't you call it quits after one more hand?
[A chair scrapes. Stanley gives a loud whack of his hand on her thigh.]
STELLA [sharply]:
That's not fun, Stanley.
[The men laugh. Stella goes into the bedroom.]
STELLA:
It makes me so mad when he does that in front of people.
BLANCHE:
I think I will bathe.
STELLA:
Again?
BLANCHE:
My nerves are in knots. Is the bathroom occupied?
STELLA:
I don't know.
[Blanche knocks. Mitch opens the door and comes out, still wiping his hands on a towel.]
BLANCHE:
Oh!--good evening.
MITCH:
Hello.
[He stares at her.]
STELLA:
Blanche, this is Harold Mitchell. My sister, Blanche DuBois.
MITCH [with awkward courtesy]:
How do you do, Miss DuBois?
STELLA:
How is your mother now, Mitch?
MITCH:
About the same, thanks. She appreciated your sending over that custard.--Excuse me, please.
[He crosses slowly back into the kitchen, glancing back at Blanche and coughing a little shyly.
He realizes he still has the towel in his hands and with an embarrassed laugh hands it to Stella.
Blanche looks after him with a certain interest.]
BLANCHE:
That one seems-superior to the others.
STELLA:
Yes, he is.
BLANCHE:
I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
STELLA:
His mother is sick.
BLANCHE:
Is he married?
STELLA:
No.
BLANCHE:
Is he a wolf?
STELLA:
Why, Blanche!
[Blanche laughs.]
I don't think he would be.
BLANCHE:
What does--what does he do?
[She is unbuttoning her blouse.]
STELLA:
He's on the precision bench in the spare parts department at the plant Stanley travels for.
BLANCHE:
Is that something much?
STELLA:
No. Stanley's the only one of his crowd that's likely to get anywhere.
BLANCHE:
What makes you think Stanley will?
STELLA:
Look at him.
BLANCHE:
I've looked at him.
STELLA:
Then you should know.
BLANCHE:
I'm sorry, but I haven't noticed the stamp of genius even on Stanley's forehead.
[She takes off the blouse and stands in her pink silk brassiere and white skirt in the light through
the portieres. The game has continued in undertones.]
STELLA:
It isn't on his forehead and it isn't genius.
BLANCHE:
Oh. Well, what is it, and where? I would like to know.
STELLA:
It's a drive that he has. You're standing in the light, Blanche!
BLANCHE:
Oh, am I!
[She moves out of the yellow streak of light. Stella has removed her dress and put on a tight blue
satin kimono.]
STELLA [with girlish laughter]:
You ought to see their wives.
BLANCHE [laughingly]:
I can imagine. Big, beefy things, I suppose.
STELLA:
You know that one upstairs?
[More laughter]
One time [laughing] the plaster-- [laughing] cracked--
STANLEY:
You hens cut out that conversation in there!
STELLA:
You can't hear us.
STANLEY:
Well, you can hear me and I said to hush up!
STELLA:
This is my house and I'll talk as much as I want to!
BLANCHE:
Stella, don't start a row.
STELLA:
He's half drunk!--I'll be out in a minute.
[She goes into the bathroom. Blanche rises and crosses leisurely to a small white radio and turns
it on.]
STANLEY:
Awright, Mitch, you in?
MITCH:
What? Oh!--No, I'm out!
[Blanche moves back into the streak of light. She raises her arms and stretches, as she moves
indolently back to the chair. Rhumba music comes over the radio. Mitch rises at the table.]
STANLEY:
Who turned that on in there?
BLANCHE:
I did. Do you mind?
STANLEY:
Turn it off!
STEVE:
Aw, let the girls have their music.
PABLO:
Sure, that's good, leave it on!
STEVE:
Sounds like Xavier Cugat!
[Stanley jumps up and, crossing to the radio, turns it off. He stops short at the sight of Blanche in
the chair. She returns his look without flinching. Then he sits again at the poker table. Two of the
men have started arguing hotly.]
STEVE: I didn't hear you name it.
PABLO:
Didn't I name it, Mitch?
MITCH:
I wasn't listenin'.
PABLO:
What were you doing, then?
STANLEY:
He was looking through them drapes.
[He jumps up and jerks roughly at curtains to close them.]
Now deal the hand over again and let's play cards or quit. Some people get ants when they win.
[Mitch rises as Stanley returns to his seat.]
STANLEY [yelling]:
Sit down!
MITCH:
I'm going to the "head". Deal me out.
PABLO:
Sure he's got ants now. Seven five-dollar bills in his pants pocket folded as tight as spitballs.
STEVE:
Tomorrow you'll see him at the cashier's window getting them changed into quarters.
STANLEY:
And when he goes home he'll deposit them one by one in a piggy bank his mother give him for
Christmas. [Dealing.]
This game is Spit in the Ocean.
[Mitch laughs uncomfortably and continues through the portieres. He stops just inside.]
BLANCHE [softly]:
Hello! The Little Boys' Room is busy right now.
MITCH:
We've--been drinking beer.
BLANCHE:
I hate beer.
MITCH:
It's--a hot weather drink.
BLANCHE:
Oh, I don't think so; it always makes me warmer. Have you got any cigs?
[She has slipped on the dark red satin wrapper.]
MITCH:
Sure.
BLANCHE:
What kind are they?
MITCH:
Luckies.
BLANCHE:
Oh, good. What a pretty case. Silver?
MITCH:
Yes. Yes; read the inscription.
BLANCHE:
Oh, is there an inscription? I can't make it out.
[He strikes a match and moves closer]
Oh!
[reading with feigned difficulty]:
"And if God choose, I shall but love thee better--after--death!" Why, that's from my favorite
sonnet by Mrs. Browning!
MITCH:
You know it?
BLANCHE:
Certainly I do!
MITCH:
There's a story connected with that inscription.
BLANCHE:
It sounds like a romance.
MITCH:
A pretty sad one.
BLANCHE:
Oh?
MITCH:
The girl's dead now.
BLANCHE in a tone of deep sympathy]:
Oh!
MITCH:
She knew she was dying when she give me this. A very strange girl, very sweet--very!
BLANCHE:
She must have been fond of you. Sick people have such deep, sincere attachments.
MITCH:
That's right, they certainly do.
BLANCHE:
Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.
MITCH:
It sure brings it out in people.
BLANCHE:
The little there is belongs to people who have experienced some sorrow.
MITCH:
I believe you are right about that.
BLANCHE:
I'm positive that I am. Show me a person who hasn't known any sorrow and I'll show you a
superficial--Listen to me! My tongue is a little-thick! You boys are responsible for it. The show
let out at eleven and we couldn't come home on account of the poker game so we had to go
somewhere and drink. I'm not accustomed to having more than one drink. Two is the limit--and
three!
[She laughs]
Tonight I had three.
STANLEY:
Mitch!
MITCH:
Deal me out I'm talking to Miss--
BLANCHE:
DuBois.
MITCH:
Miss DuBois?
BLANCHE:
It's a French name. It means woods and Blanche means white, so the two together mean white
woods. Like an orchard in spring! You can remember it by that.
MITCH:
You're French?
BLANCHE:
We are French by extraction. Our first American ancestors were French Huguenots.
MITCH:
You are Stella's sister, are you not?
BLANCHE:
Yes, Stella is my precious little sister. I call her little in spite of the fact she's somewhat older
than I. Just slightly. Less than a year. Will you do something for me?
MITCH:
Sure. What?
BLANCHE:
I bought this adorable little colored paper lantern at a Chinese shop on Bourbon. Put it over the
light bulb! Will you, please?
MITCH:
Be glad to.
BLANCHE:
I can't stand a naked light bulb, any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action.
MITCH [adjusting the lantern]:
I guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch.
BLANCHE:
I'm very adaptable--to circumstances.
MITCH:
Well, that's a good thing to be. You are visiting Stanley and Stella?
BLANCHE:
Stella hasn't been so well lately, and I came down to help her for a while. She's very run down.
MITCH:
You're not--?
BLANCHE:
Married? No, no. I'm an old maid schoolteacher!
MITCH :
You may teach school but you're certainly not an old maid.
BLANCHE:
Thank you, sir! I appreciate your gallantry!
MITCH:
So you are in the teaching profession?
BLANCHE:
Yes. Ah, yes...
MITCH:
Grade school or high school or--
STANLEY [bellowing]:
Mitch!
MITCH:
Coming!
BLANCHE:
Gracious, what lung-power!... I teach high school. In Laurel.
MITCH:
What do you teach? What subject?
BLANCHE:
Guess!
MITCH:
I bet you teach art or music?
[Blanche laughs delicately]
Of course I could be wrong. You might teach arithmetic.
BLANCHE:
Never arithmetic, sir, never arithmetic!
[with a laugh]
I don't even know my multiplication tables! No, I have the misfortune of being an English
instructor. I attempt to instill a bunch of bobby-soxers and drug-store Romeos with reverence for
Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe!
MITCH:
I guess that some of them are more interested in other things.
BLANCHE:
How very right you are! Their literary heritage is not what most of them treasure above all else!
But they're sweet things! And in the spring, it's touching to notice them making their first
discovery of love! As if nobody had ever known it before!
[The bathroom door opens and Stella comes out. Blanche continues talking to Mitch.]
Oh! Have you finished? Wait--I'll turn on the radio.
[She turns the knobs on the radio and it begins to play "Wien, Wien, nur du allein." Blanche
waltzes to the music with romantic gestures. Mitch is delighted and moves in awkward imitation
like a dancing bear.
[Stanley stalks fiercely through the portieres into the bedroom. He crosses to the small white
radio and snatches it off the table. With a shouted oath, he tosses the instrument out the window.]
STELLA:
Drunk--drunk--animal thing, you!
[She rushes through to the poker table]
All of you--please go home! If any of you have one spark of decency in you--
BLANCHE [wildly]:
Stella, watch out, he's--
[Stanley charges after Stella.]
men [feebly]:
Take it easy, Stanley. Easy, fellow.--Let's all--
STELLA:
You lay your hands on me and I'll--
[She backs out of sight. He advances and disappears. There is the sound of a blow. Stella cries
out. Blanche screams and runs into the kitchen. The men rush forward and there is grappling and
cursing. Something is overturned with a crash.]
BLANCHE [shrilly]:
My sister is going to have a baby!
MITCH:
This is terrible.
BLANCHE:
Lunacy, absolute lunacy!
MITCH:
Get him in here, men.
[Stanley is forced, pinioned by the two men, into the bedroom. He nearly throws them off. Then
all at once he subsides and is limp in their grasp. They speak quietly and lovingly to him and he
leans his face on one of their shoulders.]
STELLA [in a high, unnatural voice, out of sight]:
I want to go away, I want to go away!
MITCH:
Poker shouldn't be played in a house with women.
[Blanche rushes into the bedroom.]
BLANCHE:
I want my sister's clothes! We'll go to that woman's upstairs!
MITCH:
Where is the clothes?
BLANCHE [opening the closet]:
I've got them!
[She rushes through to Stella]
Stella, Stella, precious! Dear, dear little sister, don't be afraid!
[With her arms around Stella, Blanche guides her to the outside door and upstairs.]
STANLEY [dully]:
What's the matter; what's happened?
MITCH:
You just blew your top, Stan.
PABLO:
He's okay, now.
STEVE:
Sure, my boy's okay!
MITCH:
Put him on the bed and get a wet towel.
PABLO:
I think coffee would do him a world of good, now.
STANLEY [thickly]:
I want water.
MITCH:
Put him under the shower!
[The men talk quietly as they lead him to the bathroom.]
STANLEY:
Let go of me, you sons of bitches!
[Sounds of blows are heard. The water goes on full tilt.]
STEVE:
Let's get quick out of here!
[They rush to the poker table and sweep up their winnings on their way out.]
MITCH [sadly but firmly]:
Poker should not be played in a house with women.
[The door closes on them and the place is still. The Negro entertainers in the bar around the
corner play "Paper Doll" slow and blue. After a moment Stanley comes out of the bathroom
dripping water and still in his clinging wet polka dot drawers.]
STANLEY:
Stella!
[There is a pause]
My baby doll's left me!
[He breaks into sobs. Then he goes to the phone and dials, still shuddering with sobs.]
Eunice? I want my baby.
[He waits a moment; then he hangs up and dials again]
Eunice! I'll keep on ringin' until I talk with my baby!
[An indistinguishable shrill voice is heard. He hurls phone to floor. Dissonant brass and piano
sounds as the rooms dim out to darkness and the outer walls appear in the night light. The "blue
piano" plays for a brief interval.
[Finally, Stanley stumbles half dressed out to the porch and down the wooden steps to the
pavement before the building. There he throws back his head like a baying hound and bellows
his wife's name:
"Stella! Stella, sweetheart! Stella!"]
STANLEY:
Stellahhhhh!
EUNICE [calling down from the door of her upper apartment]:
Quit that howling out there an' go back to bed!
STANLEY:
I want my baby down here. Stella, Stella!
EUNICE:
She ain't comin' down so you quit! Or you'll git th' law on you!
STANLEY:
Stella!
EUNICE:
You can't beat on a woman an' then call 'er back! She won't come! And her goin' t' have a
baby!... You stinker! You whelp of a Polack, you! I hope they do haul you in and turn the fire
hose on you, same as the last time!
STANLEY [humbly]:
Eunice, I want my girl to come down with me!
EUNICE:
Hah!
[She slams her door.]
STANLEY [with heaven-splitting violence]:
STELLLAHHHHH!
[The low-tone clarinet moans. The door upstairs opens again. Stella slips down the rickety stairs
in her robe. Her eyes are glistening with tears and her hair loose about her throat and shoulders.
They stare at each other. Then they come together with low, animal moans. He falls to his knees
on the steps and presses his face to her belly, curving a little with maternity. Her eyes go blind
with tenderness as she catches his head and raises him level with her. He snatches the screen
door open and lifts her off her feet and bears her into the dark flat.]
[Blanche comes out on the upper landing in her robe and slips fearfully down the steps.]
BLANCHE:
Where is my little sister? Stella? Stella?
[She stops before the dark entrance of her sister's flat. Then catches her breath as if struck. She
rushes down to the walk before the house. She looks right and left as if for a sanctuary.
[The music fades away. Mitch appears from around the corner.]
MITCH:
Miss DuBois?
BLANCHE:
Oh!
MITCH:
All quiet on the Potomac now?
BLANCHE:
She ran downstairs and went back in there with him.
MITCH:
Sure she did.
BLANCHE:
I'm terrified!
MITCH:
Ho-ho! There's nothing to be scared of. They're crazy about each other.
BLANCHE:
I'm not used to such--
MITCH:
Naw, it's a shame this had to happen when you just got here. But don't take it serious.
BLANCHE:
Violence! Is so--
MITCH:
Set down on the steps and have a cigarette with me.
BLANCHE:
I'm not properly dressed.
MITCH:
That don't make no difference in the Quarter.
BLANCHE:
Such a pretty silver case.
MITCH:
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
[During the pause, she looks up at the sky]
There's so much--so much confusion in the world....
[He coughs diffidently]
Thank you for being so kind! I need kindness now.
SCENE FOUR
It is early the following morning. There is a confusion of street cries like a choral chant. Stella is
lying down in the bedroom. Her face is serene in the early morning sunlight. One hand rests on
her belly, rounding slightly with new maternity. From the other dangles a book of colored
comics. Her eyes and lips have that almost narcotized tranquility that is the faces of Eastern
idols. The table is sloppy with remains of breakfast and the debris of the preceding night, and
Stanley's gaudy pyjamas lie across the threshold of the bathroom. The outside door is slightly
ajar on a sky of summer brilliance. Blanche appears at this door. She has spent a sleepless night
and her appearance entirely contrasts with Stella's. She presses her knuckles nervously to her lips
as she looks through the door, before entering.
BLANCHE:
Stella?
STELLA [stirring lazily]'. Hmmh?
[Blanche utters a moaning cry and runs into the bedroom, throwing herself down beside Stella in
a rush of hysterical tenderness.]
BLANCHE:
Baby, my baby sister!
STELLA [drawing away from her]:
Blanche, what is the matter with you?
[Blanche straightens up slowly and stands beside the bed looking down at her sister with
knuckles pressed to her lips.]
BLANCHE:
He's left?
STELLA:
Stan? Yes.
BLANCHE:
Will he be back?
STELLA:
He's gone to get the car greased. Why?
BLANCHE:
Why! I've been half crazy, Stella! When I found out you'd been insane enough to come back in
here after what happened--I started to rush in after you!
STELLA:
I'm glad you didn't.
BLANCHE:
What were you thinking of?
[Stella makes an indefinite gesture]
Answer me! What? What?
STELLA:
Please, Blanche! Sit down and stop yelling.
BLANCHE:
All right, Stella. I will repeat the question quietly now. How could you come back in this place
last night? Why, you must have slept with him!
[Stella gets up in a calm and leisurely way.]
STELLA:
Blanche, I'd forgotten how excitable you are. You're making much too much fuss about this.
BLANCHE:
Am I?
STELLA:
Yes, you are, Blanche. I know how it must have seemed to you and I'm awful sorry it had to
happen, but it wasn't anything as serious as you seem to take it. In the first place, when men are
drinking and playing poker anything can happen. It's always a powder-keg. He
didn't know what he was doing.... He was as good as a lamb when I came back and he's really
very, very ashamed of himself.
BLANCHE:
And that--that makes it all right?
STELLA:
No, it isn't all right for anybody to make such a terrible row, but--people do sometimes. Stanley's
always smashed things. Why, on our wedding night--soon as we came in here--he snatched off
one of my slippers and rushed about the place amashing the light bulbs with it.
BLANCHE:
He did--what?
STELLA:
He smashed all the light bulbs with the heel of my slipper!
[She laughs.]
BLANCHE:
And you--you let him? Didn't run, didn't scream?
STELLA:
I was--sort of--thrilled by it.
[She waits for a moment.]
Eunice and you had breakfast'
BLANCHE:
Do you suppose I wanted my breakfast?
STELLA:
There's some coffee left on the stove.
BLANCHE:
You're so--matter of fact about it, Stella.
STELLA:
What other can I be? He's taken the radio to get it fixed. It didn't land on the pavement so only
one tube was smashed.
BLANCHE:
And you are standing there smiling!
STELLA:
What do you want me to do?
BLANCHE:
Pull yourself together and face the facts.
STELLA:
What are they, in your opinion?
BLANCHE:
In my opinion? You're married to a madman!
STELLA:
No!
BLANCHE:
Yes, you are, your fix is worse than mine is! Only you're not being sensible about it. I'm going to
do something. Get hold of myself and make myself a new life!
STELLA:
Yes?
BLANCHE:
But you've given in. And that isn't right, you're not old! You can get out.
STELLA [slowly and emphatically]:
I'm not in anything I want to get out of.
BLANCHE [incredulously]:
What--Stella?
STELLA:
I said I am not in anything that I have a desire to get out of. Look at the mess in this room! And
those empty bottles! They went through two cases last night! He promised this morning that he
was going to quit having these poker parties, but you know how long such a promise is going to
keep. Oh, well, it's his pleasure, like mine is movies and bridge. People have got to tolerate each
other's habits, I guess.
BLANCHE:
I don't understand you.
[Stella turns toward her]
I don't understand your indifference. Is this a Chinese philosophy you've--cultivated?
STELLA:
Is what--what?
BLANCHE:
This--shuffling about and mumbling--"One tube smashed--beer bottles--mess in the kitchen."--as
if nothing out of the ordinary has happened!
[Stella laughs uncertainly and picking up the broom, twirls it in her hands.]
BLANCHE:
Are you deliberately shaking that thing in my face?
STELLA:
No.
BLANCHE:
Stop it. Let go of that broom. I won't have you cleaning up for him!
STELLA:
Then who's going to do it? Are you?
BLANCHE:
I? I!
STELLA:
No, I didn't think so.
BLANCHE:
Oh, let me think, if only my mind would function! We've got to get hold of some money, that's
the way out!
STELLA:
I guess that money is always nice to get hold of.
BLANCHE:
Listen to me. I have an idea of some kind.
[Shakily she twists a cigarette into her holder]
Do you remember Shep Huntleigh?
[Stella shakes her head.]
Of course you remember Shep Huntleigh. I went out with him at college and wore his pin for a
while. Well--
STELLA.:
Well?
BLANCHE:
I ran into him last winter. You know I went to Miami during the Christmas holidays?
STELLA:
No.
BLANCHE:
Well, I did. I took the trip as an investment, thinking I'd meet someone with a million dollars.
STELLA:
Did you?
BLANCHE:
Yes. I ran into Shep Huntleigh--I ran into him on Biscayne Boulevard, on Christmas Eve, about
dusk... getting into his car--Cadillac convertible; must have been a block long!
STELLA:
I should think it would have been--inconvenient in trafflc!
BLANCHE:
You've heard of oil-wells?
STELLA:
Yes--remotely.
BLANCHE:
He has them, all over Texas. Texas is literally spouting gold in his pockets.
STELLA:
My, my.
BLANCHE:
Y'know how indifferent I am to money. I think of money in terms of what it does for you. But he
could do it, he could certainly do it!
STELLA:
Do what, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Why--set us up in a--shop!
STELLA:
What kind of a shop?
BLANCHE:
Oh, a--shop of some kind! He could do it with half what his wife throws away at the races.
STELLA:
He's married?
BLANCHE:
Honey, would I be here if the man weren't married?
[Stella laughs a little. Blanche suddenly springs up and crosses to phone. She speaks shrilly]
How do I get Western Union?--Operator! Western Union!
STELLA:
That's a dial phone, honey.
BLANCHE:
I can't dial, I'm too--
STELLA:
Just dial 0.
BLANCHE:
O?
STELLA:
Yes, "0" for Operator!
[Blanche considers a moment; then she puts the phone down.]
BLANCHE:
Give me a pencil. Where is a slip of paper? I've got to write it down first--the message, I mean...
[She goes to the dressing table, and grabs up a sheet of Kleenex and an eyebrow pencil for
writing equipment.] Let me see now...
[She bites the pencil]
"Darling Shep. Sister and I in desperate situation."
STELLA:
I beg your pardon!
BLANCHE:
"Sister and I in desperate situation. Will explain details later. Would you be interested in--?"
[She bites the pencil again] "Would you be--interested--in..."
[She smashes the pencil on the table and springs up]
You never get anywhere with direct appeals!
STELLA [with a laugh]:
Don't be so ridiculous, darling!
BLANCHE:
But I'll think of something, I've got to think of--something! Don't, don't laugh at me, Stella!
Please, please don't--I--I want you to look at the contents of my purse! Here's what's in it!
[She snatches her purse open]
Sixty-five measly cents in coin of the realm!
STELLA [crossing to bureau]:
Stanley doesn't give me a regular allowance, he likes to pay bills himself, but--this morning he
gave me ten dollars to smooth things over. You take five of it, Blanche, and I'll keep the rest
BLANCHE:
Oh, no. No, Stella.
STELLA [insisting]:
I know how it helps your morale just having a little pocket-money on you.
BLANCHE:
No, thank you--I'll take to the streets!
STELLA:
Talk sense! How did you happen to get so low on funds?
BLANCHE:
Money just goes--it goes places.
[She rubs her forehead]
Sometime today I've got to get hold of a bromo!
STELLA:
I'll fix you one now.
BLANCHE:
Not yet--I've got to keep thinking!
STELLA:
I wish you'd just let things go, at least for a--while....
BLANCHE:
Stella, I can't live with him! You can, he's your husband. But how could I stay here with him,
after last night, with, just those curtains between us?
STELLA:
Blanche, you saw him at his worst last night
BLANCHE:
On the contrary, I saw him at his best! What such a man has to offer is animal force and he gave
a wonderful exhibition of that! But the only way to live with such a man is to--go to bed with
him! And that's your job--not mine!
STELLA:
After you've rested a little, you'll see it's going to work out. You don't have to worry about
anything while you're here. I mean--expenses...
BLANCHE:
I have to plan for us both, to get us both--out!
STELLA:
You take it for granted that I am in something that I want to get out of.
BLANCHE:
I take it for granted that you still have sufficient memory of Belle Reve to find this place and
these poker players impossible to live with.
STELLA:
Well, you're taking entirely too much for granted.
BLANCHE:
I can't believe you're in earnest
STELLA:
No?
BLANCHE:
I understand how it happened--a little. You saw him in uniform, an officer, not here but--
STELLA:
I'm not sure it would have made any difference where I saw him.
BLANCHE:
Now don't say it was one of those mysterious electric things between people! If you do I'll laugh
in your face.
STELLA:
I am not going to say anything more at all about it!
BLANCHE:
All right, then, don't!
STELLA:
But there are things that happen between a man and a woman in the dark--that sort of make
everything else seem--unimportant
[Pause.]
BLANCHE:
What you are talking about is brutal desire--just--Desire!--the name of that rattle-trap streetcar
that bangs through the Quarter, up one old narrow street and down another....
STELLA:
Haven't you ever ridden on that streetcar?
BLANCHE:
It brought me here.--Where I'm not wanted and where I'm ashamed to be....
STELLA:
Then don't you think your superior attitude is a bit out of place?
BLANCHE:
I am not being or feeling at all superior, Stella. Believe me I'm not! It's just this. This is how I
look at it. A man like that is someone to go out with--once--twice--three times when the devil is
in you. But live with? Have a child by?
STELLA:
I have told you I love him.
BLANCHE:
Then I tremble for you! I just--tremble for you....
STELLA:
I can't help your trembling if you insist on trembling!
[There is a pause.]
BLANCHE:
May I--speak--plainly?
STELLA:
Yes, do. Go ahead. As plainly as you want to.
[Outside, a train approaches. They are silent till the noise subsides. They are both in the
bedroom.
[Under cover of the train's noise Stanley enters from outside. He stands unseen by the women,
holding some packages in his arms, and overhears their following conversation. He wears an
undershirt and grease-stained seersucker pants.]
BLANCHE:
Well--if you'll forgive me--he's common!
STELLA:
Why, yes, I suppose he is.
BLANCHE:
Suppose! You can't have forgotten that much of our bringing up, Stella, that you just suppose
that any part of a gentleman's in his nature! Not one particle, no! Oh, if he was just--ordinary!
Just plain--but good and wholesome, but--no. There's something downright--bestial--about him!
You're hating me saying this, aren't you?
STELLA [coldly]:
Go on and say it all, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
He acts like an animal, has an animal's habits! Eats like one, moves like one, talks like one!
There's even something--sub-human--something not quite to the stage of humanity yet! Yes,
something--ape-like about him, like one of those pictures I've seen in--anthropological studies!
Thousands and thousands of years have passed him right by, and there he is--Stanley Kowalski--
survivor of the stone age! Bearing the raw meat home from the kill in the jungle! And you--you
here--waiting for him! Maybe he'll strike you or maybe grunt and kiss you! That is, if kisses have
been discovered yet! Night falls and the other apes gather! There in the front of the cave, all
grunting like him, and swilling and gnawing and hulking! His poker night!--you call it--this party
of apes! Somebody growls--some creature snatches at something--the fight is on! God! Maybe
we are a long way from being made in God's image, but Stella--my sister--there has been some
progress since then! Such things as art--as poetry and music--such kinds of new light have come
into the world since then! In some kinds of people some tenderer feelings have had some
little beginning! That we have got to make grow! And cling to, and hold as our flag! In this dark
march toward whatever it is we're approaching.... Don't--don't hang back with the brutes!
[Another train passes outside. Stanley hesitates, licking his lips. Then suddenly he turns stealthily
about and withdraws through front door. The women are still unaware of his presence. When the
train has passed he calls through the closed front door.]
STANLEY:
Hey! Hey, Stella!
STELLA [who has listened gravely to Blanche]:
Stanley!
BLANCHE:
Stell, I
[But Stella has gone to the front door. Stanley enters casually with his packages.]
STANLEY:
Hiyuh, Stella. Blanche back?
STELLA:
Yes, she's back.
STANLEY:
Hiyuh, Blanche.
[He grins at her.]
STELLA:
You must've got under the car.
STANLEY:
Them dam mechanics at Fritz's don't know their ass fr'm--Hey!
[Stella has embraced him--with both arms, fiercely, and full in the view of Blanche. He laughs
and clasps her head to him. Over her head he grins through the curtains at Blanche.]
[As the lights fade away, with a lingering brightness on their embrace, the music of the "blue
piano" and trumpet and drums is heard.]
SCENE FIVE
Blanche is seated in the bedroom fanning herself with a palm leaf as she reads over a just
completed letter. Suddenly she bursts into a peal of laughter. Stella is dressing in the bedroom.
STELLA:
What are you laughing at, honey?
BLANCHE:
Myself, myself, for being such a liar! I'm writing a letter to Shep.
[She picks up the letter]
"Darling Shep. I am spending the summer on the wing, making flying visits here and there. And
who knows, perhaps I shall take a sudden notion to swoop down on Dallas! How would you feel
about that? Ha-ha!
[She laughs nervously and brightly, touching her throat as if actually talking to Shep]
Forewarned is forearmed, as they say!"--How does that sound?
STELLA:
Uh-huh...
BLANCHE [going on nervously]:
"Most of my sister's friends go north in the summer but some have homes on the Gulf and there
has been a continued round of entertainments, teas, cocktails, and luncheons--"
[A disturbance is heard upstairs at the Hubbells' apartment.]
STELLA:
Eunice seems to be having some trouble with Steve.
[Eunice's voice shouts in terrible wrath.]
EUNICE:
I heard about you and that blonde!
STEVE:
That's a damn lie!
EUNICE:
You ain't pulling the wool over my eyes! I wouldn't mind if you'd stay down at the Four Deuces,
but you always going up.
STEVE:
Who ever seen me up?
EUNICE:
I seen you chasing her 'round the balcony--I'm gonna call the vice squad!
STEVE:
Don't you throw that at me!
EUNICE [shrieking]:
You hit me! I'm gonna call the police!
[A clatter of aluminum striking a wall is heard, followed by a man's angry roar, shouts and
overturned furniture. There is a crash; then a relative hush.]
BLANCHE [brightly]:
Did he kill her?
[Eunice appears on the steps in daemonic disorder.]
STELLA:
No! She's coming downstairs.
EUNICE:
Call the police. I'm going to call the police!
[She rushes around the comer.]
[They laugh lightly. Stanley comes around the corner in his green-and-scarlet silk bowling shirt.
He trots up the steps and bangs into the kitchen. Blanche registers his entrance with nervous
gestures.]
STANLEY:
What's a matter with Eun-uss?
STELLA:
She and Steve had a row. Has she got the police?
STANLEY:
Naw. She's gettin' a drink.
STELLA:
That's much more practical!
[Steve comes down nursing a bruise on his forehead and looks in the door.]
STEVE:
She here?
STANLEY:
Naw, naw. At the Four Deuces.
STEVE:
That rutting hunk!
[He looks around the corner a bit timidly, then turns with affected boldness and runs after her.]
BLANCHE:
I must jot that down in my notebook. Ha-ha! I'm compiling a notebook of quaint little words and
phrases I've picked up here.
STANLEY:
You won't pick up nothing here you ain't heard before.
BLANCHE:
Can I count on that?
STANLEY:
You can count on it up to five hundred.
BLANCHE:
That's a mighty high number.
[He jerks open the bureau drawer, slams it shut and throws shoes in a corner. At each noise
Blanche winces slightly. Finally she speaks]
What sign were you born under?
STANLEY [while he is dressing]:
Sign?
BLANCHE:
Astrological sign. I bet you were born under Aries. Aries people are forceful and dynamic. They
dote on noise! They love to bang things around! You must have had lots of banging around in the
army and now that you're out, you make up for it by treating inanimate objects with such a fury!
[Stella has been going in and out of closet during this scene. Now she pops her head out of the
closet.]
STELLA:
Stanley was born just five minutes after Christmas.
BLANCHE:
Capricorn--the Goat!
STANLEY:
What sign were you born under?
BLANCHE:
Oh, my birthday's next month, the fifteenth of September; that's under Virgo.
STANLEY:
What's Virgo?
BLANCHE:
Virgo is the Virgin.
STANLEY [contemptuously]:
Bah!
[He advances a little as he knots his tie]
Say, do you happen to know somebody named Shaw?
[Her face expresses a faint shock. She reaches for the cologne bottle and dampens her
handkerchief as she answers carefully.]
BLANCHE:
Why, everybody knows somebody named Shaw!
STANLEY:
Well, this somebody named Shaw is under the impression he met you in Laurel, but I figure he
must have got you mixed up with some other party because this other party is someone he met at
a hotel called the Flamingo.
[Blanche laughs breathlessly as she touches the cologne-dampened handkerchief to her temples.]
BLANCHE:
I'm afraid he does have me mixed up with this "other party." The Hotel Flamingo is not the sort
of establishment I would dare to be seen in!
STANLEY:
You know of it?
BLANCHE:
Yes, I've seen it and smelled it
STANLEY:
You must've got pretty close if you could smell it
BLANCHE:
The odor of cheap perfume is penetrating.
STANLEY:
That stuff you use is expensive?
BLANCHE:
Twenty-five dollars an ounce! I'm nearly out. That's just a hint if you want to remember my
birthday!
[She speaks lightly but her voice has a note of fear.]
STANLEY:
Shaw must've got you mixed up. He goes in and out of Laurel all the time so he can check on it
and clear up any mistake.
[He turns away and crosses to the portieres. Blanche closes her eyes as if faint. Her hand
trembles as she lifts the handkerchief again to her forehead.
[Steve and Eunice come around corner. Steve's arm is around Eunice's shoulder and she is
sobbing luxuriously and he is cooing love-words. There is a murmur of thunder as they go
slowly upstairs in a tight embrace.]
STANLEY [to Stella]:
I'll wait for you at the Four Deuces!
STELLA:
Hey! Don't I rate one kiss?
STANLEY:
Not in front of your sister.
[He goes out. Blanche rises from her chair. She seems faint; looks about her with an expression
of almost panic.]
BLANCHE:
Stella! What have you heard about me?
STELLA:
Huh?
BLANCHE:
What have people been telling you about me?
STELLA:
Telling?
BLANCHE:
You haven't heard any--unkind--gossip about me?
STELLA:
Why, no, Blanche, of course not!
BLANCHE:
Honey, there was--a good deal of talk in Laurel.
STELLA:
About you, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
I wasn't so good the last two years or so, after Belle Reve had started to slip through my fingers.
STELLA:
All of us do things we--
BLANCHE:
I never was hard or sell-sufficient enough. When people are soft--soft people have got to
shimmer and glow--they've got to put on soft colors, the colors of butterfly wings, and put a--
paper lantern over the light.... It isn't enough to be soft. You've got to be soft and attractive. And
I--I'm fading now! I don't know how much longer I can turn the trick.
[The afternoon has faded to dusk. Stella goes into the bedroom and turns on the light under the
paper lantern. She holds a bottled soft drink in her hand.]
BLANCHE:
Have you been listening to me?
STELLA:
I don't listen to you when you are being morbid!
[She advances with the bottled coke.]
BLANCHE [with abrupt change to gaiety]:
Is that coke for me?
STELLA:
Not for anyone else!
BLANCHE:
Why, you precious thing, you! Is it just coke?
STELLA [turning]:
You mean you want a shot in it!
BLANCHE:
Well, honey, a shot never does a coke any harm! Let me! You mustn't wait on me!
STELLA:
I like to wait on you, Blanche. It makes it seem more like home.
[She goes into the kitchen, finds a glass and pours a shot of whiskey into it.]
BLANCHE:
I have to admit I love to be waited on....
[She rushes into the bedroom. Stella goes to her with the glass. Blanche suddenly clutches
Stella's free hand with a moaning sound and presses the hand to her lips. Stella is embarrassed by
her show of emotion. Blanche speaks in a choked voice.]
You're--you're--so good to me! And I--
STELLA:
Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I know, I won't! You hate me to talk sentimental! But honey, believe I feel things more than I tell
you! I won't stay long! I won't, I promise I--
STELLA:
Blanche!
BLANCHE [hysterically]:
I won't, I promise, I'll go! Go soon! I will really! I won't hang around until he--throws me out...
STELLA:
Now will you stop talking foolish?
BLANCHE:
Yes, honey. Watch how you pour--that fizzy stuff foams over!
[Blanche laughs shrilly and grabs the glass, but her hand shakes so it almost slips from her grasp.
Stella pours the coke into the glass. It foams over and spills. Blanche gives a piercing cry.]
STELLA [shocked by the cry]:
Heavens!
BLANCHE:
Right on my pretty white skirt!
STELLA:
Oh... Use my hanky. Blot gently.
BLANCHE [slowly recovering]:
I know--gently--gently...
STELLA:
Did it stain?
BLANCHE:
Not a bit. Ha-ha! Isn't that lucky?
[She sits down shaking, taking a grateful drink. She holds the glass in both hands and continues
to laugh a little.]
STELLA:
Why did you scream like that?
BLANCHE:
I don't know why I screamed!
[continuing nervously]
Mitch--Mitch is coming at seven. I guess I am just feeling nervous about our relations.
[She begins to talk rapidly and breathlessly]
He hasn't gotten a thing but a goodnight kiss, that's all I have given him, Stella. I want his
respect. And men don't want anything they get too easy. But on the other hand men lose interest
quickly. Especially when the girl is over--thirty. They think a girl over thirty ought to--the vulgar
term is--"put out."... And I--I'm not "putting out." Of course he--he doesn't know--I mean I
haven't informed him--of my real age!
STELLA:
Why are you sensitive about your age?
BLANCHE:
Because of hard knocks my vanity's been given. What I mean is--he thinks I'm sort of--prim and
proper, you know!
[She laughs out sharply] I want to deceive him enough to make him--want me...
STELLA:
Blanche, do you want him?
BLANCHE:
I want to rest! I want to breathe quietly again! Yes--I want Mitch... very badly! Just think! If it
happens, I can leave here and not be anyone's problem....
[Stanley comes around the corner with a drink under his belt.]
STANLEY [bawling]:
Hey, Steve! Hey, Eunice! Hey, Stella!
[There are joyous calls from above. Trumpet and drums are heard from around the corner.]
STELLA [kissing Blanche impulsively]:
It will happen!
BLANCHE [doubtfully]:
It will?
STELLA:
It will!
[She goes across into the kitchen, looking back at Blanche.]
It will, honey, it will.... But don't take another drink!
[Her voice catches as she goes out the door to meet her husband.
[Blanche sinks faintly back in her chair--with her drink. Eunice shrieks with laughter and runs
down the steps. Steve bounds after her--with goat-like screeches and chases her around corner.
Stanley and Stella twine arms as they follow, laughing.
[Dusk settles deeper. The music from the Four Deuces is slow and blue.]
BLANCHE:
Ah, me, ah, me, ah, me...
[Her eyes fall shut and the palm leaf fan drops from her fingers. She slaps her hand on the chair
arm a couple of times. There is a little glimmer of lightning about the building.
[A Young Man comes along the street and rings the bell.]
BLANCHE:
Come in.
[The Young Man appears through the portieres. She regards him with interest.]
BLANCHE:
Well, well! What can I do for you?
YOUNG MAN:
I'm collecting for The Evening Star.
BLANCHE:
I didn't know that stars took up collections.
YOUNG MAN:
It's the paper.
BLANCHE:
I know. I was joking--feebly! Will you--have a drink?
YOUNG MAN:
No, ma'am. No, thank you. I can't drink on the job.
BLANCHE:
Oh, well, now, let's see.... No, I don't have a dime! I'm not the lady of the house. I'm her sister
from Mississippi. I'm one of those poor relations you've heard about.
YOUNG MAN: That's all right I'll drop by later.
[He starts to go out. She approaches a little.]
BLANCHE:
Hey!
[He turns back shyly. She puts a cigarette in a long holder]
Could you give me a light?
[She crosses toward him. They meet at the door between the two rooms.]
YOUNG MAN:
Sure.
[He takes out a lighter]
This doesn't always work
BLANCHE:
It's temperamental?
[It flares]
Ah!--thank you.
[He starts away again]
Hey!
[He turns again, still more uncertainly. She goes close to him]
Uh--what time is it?
YOUNG MAN:
Fifteen of seven, ma'am.
BLANCHE:
So late? Don't you just love these long rainy afternoons in New Orleans when an hour isn't just
an hour--but a little piece of eternity dropped into your hands--and who knows what to do with
it?
[She touches his shoulders.]
You--uh--didn't get wet in the rain?
YOUNG MAN:
No, ma'am. I stepped inside.
BLANCHE:
In a drug-store? And had a soda?
YOUNG MAN:
Uh-huh.
BLANCHE:
Chocolate?
YOUNG MAN:
No, ma'am. Cherry.
BLANCHE [laughing]:
Cherry!
YOUNG MAN:
A cherry soda.
BLANCHE:
You make my mouth water.
[She touches his cheek lightly, and smiles. Then she goes to the trunk.]
YOUNG MAN:
Well, I'd better be going--
BLANCHE [stopping him]:
Young man!
[He turns. She takes a large, gossamer scarf from the trunk and drapes it about her shoulders.]
[In the ensuing pause, the "blue piano" is heard. It continues through the rest of this scene and
the opening of the next. The young man clears his throat and looks yearningly at the door.]
Young man! Young, young, young man! Has anyone ever told you that you look like a young
Prince out of the Arabian Nights?
[The Young Man laughs uncomfortably and stands like a bashful kid. Blanche speaks softly to
him.]
Well, you do, honey lamb! Come here. I want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your
mouth!
[Without waiting for him to accept, she crosses quickly to him and presses her lips to his.]
Now run along, now, quickly! It would be nice to keep you, but I've got to be good--and keep my
hands off children.
[He stares at her a moment. She opens the door for him and blows a kiss at him as he goes down
the steps with a dazed look. She stands there a little dreamily after he has disappeared. Then
Mitch appears around the corner with a bunch of roses.]
BLANCHE [gaily]:
Look who's coming! My Rosenkavalier! Bow to me first... now present them! Ahhh--Merciiii!
[She looks at him over them, coquettishly pressing them to her lips. He beams at her selfconsciously.]
SCENE SIX
It is about two A.M. on the same evening. The outer wall of the building is visible. Blanche and
Mitch come in. The utter exhaustion which only a neurasthenic personality can know is evident
in Blanche's voice and manner. Mitch is stolid but depressed. They have probably been out to the
amusement park on Lake Pontchartrain, for Mitch is bearing, upside down, a plaster statuette of
Mae West, the sort of prize won at shooting-galleries and carnival games of chance.
BLANCHE [stopping lifelessly at the steps]:
Well--
[Mitch laughs uneasily.] Well...
MITCH:
I guess it must be pretty late--and you're tired.
BLANCHE:
Even the hot tamale man has deserted the street, and he hangs on till the end.
[Mitch laughs uneasily again] How will you get home?
MITCH:
I'll walk over to Bourbon and catch an owl-car.
BLANCHE [laughing grimly]:
Is that streetcar named Desire still grinding along the tracks at this hour?
MITCH [heavily]:
I'm afraid you haven't gotten much fun out of this evening, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I spoiled it for you.
MITCH:
No, you didn't, but I felt all the time that I wasn't giving you much--entertainment.
BLANCHE:
I simply couldn't rise to the occasion. That was all. I don't think I've ever tried so hard to be gay
and made such a dismal mess of it. I get ten points for trying!--I did try.
MITCH:
Why did you try if you didn't feel like it, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
I was just obeying the law of nature.
MITCH:
Which law is that?
BLANCHE:
The one that says the lady must entertain the gentleman--or no dice! See if you can locate my
door-key in this purse. When I'm so tired my fingers are all thumbs!
MITCH [rooting in her purse]:
This it?
BLANCHE:
No, honey, that's the key to my trunk which I must soon be packing.
MITCH:
You mean you are leaving here soon?
BLANCHE:
I've outstayed my welcome.
MITCH:
This it?
[The music fades away.]
BLANCHE:
Eureka! Honey, you open the door while I take a last look at the sky.
[She leans on the porch rail. He opens the door and stands awkwardly behind her.]
I'm looking for the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters, but these girls are not out tonight. Oh, yes they
are, there they are! God bless them! All in a bunch going home from their little bridge party....
Y'get the door open? Good boy! I guess you--want to go now....
[He shuffles and coughs a little.]
MITCH:
Can I--uh--kiss you-goodnight?
BLANCHE:
Why do you always ask me if you may?
MITCH:
I don't know whether you want me to or not.
BLANCHE:
Why should you be so doubtful?
MITCH:
That night when we parked by the lake and I kissed you, you--
BLANCHE:
Honey, it wasn't the kiss I objected to. I liked the kiss very much. It was the other little--
familiarity--that I--felt obliged to--discourage.... I didn't resent it! Not a bit in the world! In fact, I
was somewhat flattered that you--desired me! But, honey, you know as well as I do that a single
girl, a girl alone in the world, has got to keep a firm hold on her emotions or she'll be lost!
MITCH [solemnly]:
Lost?
BLANCHE:
I guess you are used to girls that like to be lost. The kind that get lost immediately, on the first
date!
MITCH:
I like you to be exactly the way that you are, because in all my--experience--I have never known
anyone like you.
[Blanche looks at him gravely; then she bursts into laughter and then claps a hand to her mouth.]
MITCH:
Are you laughing at me?
BLANCHE:
No, honey. The lord and lady of the house have not yet returned, so come in. We'll have a nightcap. Let's leave the lights off. Shall we?
MITCH:
You just--do what you want to.
[Blanche precedes him into the kitchen. The outer wall of the building disappears and the
interiors of the two rooms can be dimly seen.]
BLANCHE [remaining in the first room]:
The other room's more comfortable--go on in. This crashing around in the dark is my search for
some liquor.
MITCH:
You want a drink?
BLANCHE:
I want you to have a drink! You have been so anxious and solemn all evening, and so have I; we
have both been anxious and solemn and now for these few last remaining moments of our lives
together--I want to create--joie de vtvre! I'm lighting a candle.
MITCH:
That's good.
BLANCHE:
We are going to be very Bohemian. We are going to pretend that we are sitting in a little artists'
cafe on the Left Bank in Paris!
[She lights a candle stub and puts it in a bottle.]
Le suis la Dame aux Camellias! Vous etes--Armand! Understand French?
MITCH [heavily]:
Naw. Naw. I--
BLANCHE:
Voutez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Vous ne comprenez pas? Ah, auelle dommage!--I mean
it's a damned good thing.... I've found some liquor. Just enough for two shots without any
dividends, honey...
MITCH [heavily]:
Thats--good.
[She enters the bedroom with the drinks and the candle]
BLANCHE:
Sit down! Why dont you take off your coat and loosen your collar?
MITCH:
I better leave it on.
BLANCHE:
No. I want you to be comfortable.
MITCH:
I am ashamed of the way I perspire. My shirt is sticking to me
BLANCHE:
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't perspire they would die in five minutes.
[She takes his coat from him]
This is a nice coat What kind of material is it?
MITCH:
They call that stuff alpaca.
BLANCHE:
Oh. Alpaca.
MITCH:
It's very light weight alpaca.
BLANCHE:
Oh. Light weight alpaca.
MITCH:
I don't like to wear a wash-coat even in summer because I sweat through it.
BLANCHE:
Oh.
MITCH:
And it don't look neat on me. A man with a heavy build has got to be careful of what he puts on
him so he don't look too clumsy.
BLANCHE:
You are not too heavy.
MITCH:
You don't think I am?
BLANCHE:
You are not the delicate type. You have a massive bone-structure and a very imposing physique.
MITCH:
Thank you. Last Christmas I was given a membership to the New Orleans Athletic Club.
BLANCHE:
Oh, good.
MITCH:
It was the finest present I ever was given. I work out there with the weights and I swim and keep
myself fit. When I started there, I was getting soft in the belly but now my belly is hard. It is so
hard now that a man can punch me in the belly and it don't hurt me. Punch me! Go on! See?
[She pokes lightly at him.]
BLANCHE:
Gracious.
[Her hand touches her chest.]
MITCH:
Guess how much I weigh, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Oh, I'd say in the vicinity of--one hundred and eighty?
MITCH:
Guess again.
BLANCHE:
Not that much?
MITCH:
No. More.
BLANCHE:
Well, you're a tall man and you can carry a good deal of weight without looking awkward.
MITCH:
I weigh two hundred and seven pounds and I'm six feet one and one-half inches tall in my bare
feet--without shoes on. And that is what I weigh stripped.
BLANCHE:
Oh, my goodness, me! It's awe-inspiring.
MITCH [embarrassed]:
My weight is not a very interesting subject to talk about
[He hesitates for a moment]
What's yours?
BLANCHE:
My weight?
MITCH:
Yes.
BLANCHE:
Guess!
MITCH:
Let me lift you.
BLANCHE:
Samson! Go on, lift me.
[He comes behind her and puts his hands on her waist and raises her lightly off the ground]
Well?
MITCH:
You are light as a feather.
BLANCHE:
Ha-ha!
[He lowers her but keeps his hands on her waist. Blanche speaks with an affectation of
demureness]
You may release me now.
MITCH:
Huh?
BLANCHE [giddly]:
I said unhand me, sir.
[He fumblingly embraces her. Her voice sounds gently reproving]
Now, Mitch. Just because Stanley and Stella aren't at home is no reason why you shouldn't
behave like a gentleman.
MITCH:
Just give me a slap whenever I step out of bounds.
BLANCHE:
That won't be necessary. You're a natural gentleman, one of the very few that are left in the
world. I don't want you to think that I am severe and old maid school teacherish or anything like
that. It's just--well--
MITCH:
Huh?
BLANCHE:
I guess it is just that I have--old-fashioned ideals!
[She rolls her eyes, knowing he cannot see her face. Mitch goes to the front door. There is a
considerable silence between them. Blanche sighs and Mitch coughs selfconsciously.]
MITCH [finally]:
Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?
BLANCHE:
They have gone out With Mr. and Mrs. Hubbell upstairs.
MITCH:
Where did they go?
BLANCHE:
I think they were planning to go to a midnight prevue at Loew's State.
MITCH:
We should all go out together some night
BLANCHE:
No. That wouldn't be a good plan.
MITCH:
Why not?
BLANCHE:
You are an old friend of Stanley's?
MITCH:
We was together in the Two-forty-first.
BLANCHE:
I guess he talks to you frankly?
MITCH:
Sure.
BLANCHE:
Has he talked to you about me?
MITCH:
Oh--not very much.
BLANCHE:
The way you say that, I suspect that he has.
MITCH:
No, he hasn't said much.
BLANCHE:
But what he has said. What would you say his attitude toward me was?
MITCH:
Why do you want to ask that?
BLANCHE:
Well--
MITCH:
Don't you get along with him?
BLANCHE:
What do you think?
MITCH:
I don't think he understands you.
BLANCHE:
That is putting it mildly. If it weren't for Stella about to have a baby, I wouldn't be able to endure
things here.
MITCH:
He isn't--nice to you?
BLANCHE:
He is insufferably rude. Goes out of his way to offend me.
MITCH:
In what way, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Why, in every conceivable way.
MITCH:
I'm surprised to hear that.
BLANCHE:
Are you?
MITCH:
Well, I--don't see how anybody could be rude to you.
BLANCHE:
It's really a pretty frightful situation. You see, there's no privacy here. There's just these portieres
between the two rooms at night. He stalks through the rooms in his underwear at night. And I
have to ask him to close the bathroom door. That sort of commonness isn't necessary. You
probably wonder why I don't move out. Well, I'll tell you frankly. A teacher's salary is barely 
sufficient for her living expenses. I didn't save a penny last year and so I had to come here for the
summer. That's why I have to put up with my sister's husband. And he has to put up with me,
apparently so much against his wishes.... Surely he must have told you how much he hates me!
MITCH:
I don't think he hates you.
BLANCHE:
He hates me. Or why would he insult me? The first time I laid eyes on him I thought to myself,
that man is my executioner! That man will destroy me, unless--
MITCH:
Blanche--
BLANCHE:
Yes, honey?
MITCH:
Can I ask you a question?
BLANCHE:
Yes. What?
MITCH:
How old are you?
[She makes a nervous gesture.]
BLANCHE:
Why do you want to know?
MITCH:
I talked to my mother about you and she said, "How old is Blanche?" And I wasn't able to tell
her.
[There is another pause.]
BLANCHE:
You talked to your mother about me?
MITCH:
Yes.
BLANCHE:
Why?
MITCH:
I told my mother how nice you were, and I liked you.
BLANCHE:
Were you sincere about that?
MITCH:
You know I was.
BLANCHE:
Why did your mother want to know my age?
MITCH:
Mother is sick.
BLANCHE:
I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?
MITCH:
She won't live long. Maybe just a few months.
BLANCHE:
Oh.
MITCH:
She worries because I'm not settled.
BLANCHE:
Oh.
MITCH:
She wants me to be settled down before she--
[His voice is hoarse and he clears his throat twice, shuffling nervously around with his hands in
and out of his pockets.]
BLANCHE:
You love her very much, don't you?
MITCH:
Yes.
BLANCHE:
I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You will be lonely when she passes on, won't
you?
[Mitch clears his throat and nods.]
I understand what that is.
MITCH:
To be lonely?
BLANCHE:
I loved someone, too, and the person I loved I lost.
MITCH:
Dead?
[She crosses to the window and sits on the sill, looking out. She pours herself another drink.]
A man?
BLANCHE:
He was a boy, just a boy, when I was a very young girl. When I was sixteen, I made the
discovery--love. All at once and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a
blinding light on something that had always been half in shadow, that's how it struck the world
for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded. There was something different about the boy, a
nervousness, a softness and tenderness which wasn't like a man's, although he wasn't the least bit
effeminate looking--still--that thing was there.... He came to me for help. I didn't know that. I
didn't find out anything till after our marriage when we'd run away and come back and all I knew 
was I'd failed him in some mysterious way and wasn't able to give the help he needed but
couldn't speak of! He was in the quicksands and clutching at me--but I wasn't holding him out, I
was slipping in with him! I didn't know that. I didn't know anything except I loved him
unendurably but without being able to help him or help myself. Then I found out. In the worst of
all possible ways. By coming suddenly into a room that I thought was empty--which wasn't
empty, but had two people in it... the boy I had married and an older man who had been his
friend for years....
[A locomotive is heard approaching outside. She claps her hands to her ears and crouches over.
The headlight of the locomotive glares into the room as it thunders past. As the noise recedes she
straightens slowly and continues speaking.]
Afterwards we pretended that nothing had been discovered. Yes, the three of us drove out to
Moon Lake Casino, very drunk and laughing all the way.
[Polka music sounds. In a minor key faint with distance.]
We danced the Varsouviana! Suddenly in the middle of the dance the boy I had married broke
away from me and ran out of the casino. A few moments later--a shot!
[The polka stops abruptly.]
[Blanche rises stiffly. Then, the polka resumes in a major key.]
I ran out--all did!--all ran and gathered about the terrible thing at the edge of the lake! I couldn't
get near for the crowding. Then somebody caught my arm. "Don't go any closer! Come back!
You don't want to see!" See? See what! Then I heard voices say--Allan! Allan! The Grey boy!
He'd stuck the revolver into his mouth, and fired--so that the back of his head had been--blown
away!
[She sways and covers her face.]
It was because--on the dance-floor--unable to stop myself--I'd suddenly said--"I saw! I know!
You disgust me..." And then the searchlight which had been turned on the world was turned off
again and never for one moment since has there been any light that's stronger than this--kitchen--
candle...
[Mitch gets up awkwardly and moves toward her a little. The polka music increases. Mitch
stands beside her.]
MITCH [drawing her slowly into his arms]:
You need somebody. And I need somebody too. Could it be--you and me, Blanche?
[She stares at him vacantly for a moment. Then with a soft cry huddles in his embrace. She
makes a sobbing effort to speak but the words won't come. He kisses her forehead and her eyes
and finally her lips. The polka tune fades out. Her breath is drawn and released in long, grateful
sobs.]
BLANCHE:
Sometimes--there's God--so quickly!
SCENE SEVEN
It is late afternoon in mid-September. The portieres are open and a table is set for a birthday
supper, with cake and flowers. Stella is completing the decorations as Stanley comes in.
STANLEY:
What's all this stuff for?
STELLA:
Honey, it's Blanche's birthday.
STANLEY:
She here?
STELLA:
In the bathroom.
STANLEY [mimicking]:
"Washing out some things"?
STELLA:
I reckon so.
STANLEY:
How long she been in there?
STELLA:
All afternoon.
STANLEY [mimicking]:
"Soaking in a hot tub"?
STELLA:
Yes.
STANLEY:
Temperature 100 on the nose, and she soaks herself in a hot tub.
STELLA:
She says it cools her off for the evening.
STANLEY:
And you run out an' get her cokes, I suppose? And serve 'em to Her Majesty in the tub?
[Stella shrugs]
Set down here a minute.
STELLA:
Stanley, I've got things to do.
STANLEY:
Set down! I've got th' dope on your big sister, Stella.
STELLA:
Stanley, stop picking on Blanche.
STANLEY:
That girl calls me common!
STELLA:
Lately you been doing all you can think of to rub her the wrong way, Stanley, and Blanche is
sensitive and you've got to realize that Blanche and I grew up under very different circumstances
than you did,
STANLEY:
So I been told. And told and told and told! You know she's been feeding us a pack of lies here?
STELLA:
No, I don't, and--
STANLEY:
Well, she has, however. But now the cat's out of the bag! I found out some things!
STELLA:
What--things?
STANLEY:
Things I already suspected. But now I got proof from the most reliable sources--which I have
checked on!
[Blanche is singing in the bathroom a saccharine popular ballad which is used contrapuntally
with Stanley's speech.]
STELLA [to Stanley]:
Lower your voice!
STANLEY:
Some canary-bird, huh!
STELLA:
Now please tell me quietly what you think you've found out about my sister.
STANLEY:
Lie Number One: All this squeamishness she puts on! You should just know the line she's been
feeding to Mitch--He thought she had never been more than kissed by a fellow! But Sister
Blanche is no lily! Ha-ha! Some lily she is!
STELLA:
What have you heard and who from?
STANLEY:
Our supply-man down at the plant has been going through Laurel for years and he knows all
about her and everybody else in the town of Laurel knows all about her. She is as famous in
Laurel as if she was the President of the United States, only she is not respected by any party!
This supply-man stops at a hotel called the Flamingo.
BLANCHE [singing blithely]:
"Say, it's only a paper moon, Sailing over a cardboard sea--But it wouldn't be make-believe If
you believed in me!"
STELLA:
What about the--Flamingo?
STANLEY:
She stayed there, too.
STELLA:
My sister lived at Belle Reve.
STANLEY:
This is after the home-place had slipped through her lily white fingers! She moved to the
Flamingo! A second class hotel which has the advantage of not interfering in the private social
life of the personalities there! The Flamingo is used to all kinds of goings-on. But even the
management of the Flamingo was impressed by Dame Blanche! In fact they were so impressed
by Dame Blanche that they requested her to turn in her room-key--for permanently! This
happened a couple of weeks before she showed here.
BLANCHE [singing]:
"It's a Barnum and Bailey world. Just as phony as it can be--But it wouldn't be make-believe if
you believed in me!"
STELLA:
What--contemptible--lies!
STANLEY:
Sure, I can see how you would be upset by this. She pulled the wool over your eyes as much as
Mitch's!
STELLA:
It's pure invention! There's not a word of truth in it and if I were a man and this creature had
dared to invent such things in my presence--
BLANCHE [singing]:
"Without your love, It's a honky-tonk parade! Without your love, It's a melody played, In a
penny arcade..."
STANLEY:
Honey, I told you I thoroughly checked on these stories! Now wait till I finish. The trouble with
Dame Blanche was that she couldn't put on her act any more in Laurel! They got wised up after
two or three dates with her and then they quit, and she goes on to another, the same old line,
same old act, same old hooey! But the town was too small for this to go on forever! And as time
went by she became a town character. Regarded as not just different but downright loco--nuts.
[Stella draws back.]
And for the last year or two she has been washed up like poison. That's why she's here this
summer, visiting royalty, putting on all this act--because she's practically told by the mayor to
get out of town! Yes, did you know there was an army camp near Laurel and your sister's was
one of the places called "Out-of-Bounds"?
BLANCHE:
"It's only a paper moon. Just as phony as it can be--But it wouldn't be make-believe, If you
believed in me!"
STANLEY:
Well, so much for her being such a refined and particular type of girl. Which brings us to Lie
Number Two.
STELLA:
I don't want to hear any more!
STANLEY:
She's not going back to teach school! In fact I am willing to bet you that she never had no idea of
returning to Laurel! She didn't resign temporarily from the high school because of her nerves!
No, siree, Bob! She didn't. They locked her out of that high school before the spring term ended-
-and I hate to tell you the reason that step was taken! A seventeen-year-old boy--she'd gotten
mixed up with!
BLANCHE:
"It's a Barnum and Bailey world, Just as phony as it can be--"
[In the bathroom the water goes on loud; little breathless cries and peals of laughter are heard as
if a child were frolicking in the tub.]
STELLA:
This is making me--sick!
STANLEY:
The boy's dad learned about it and got in touch with the high school superintendent. Boy, oh,
boy, I'd like to have been in that office when Dame Blanche was called on the carpet! I'd like to
have seen her trying to squirm out of that one! But they had her on the hook good and proper that
time and she knew that the jig was all up! They told her she better move on to some fresh
territory. Yep, it was practickly a town ordinance passed against her!
[The bathroom door is opened and Blanche thrusts her head out, holding a towel about her hair.]
BLANCHE:
Stella!
Stella [faintly]:
Yes, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Give me another bath-towel to dry my hair with. I've just washed it.
STELLA:
Yes, Blanche.
[She crosses in a dazed way from the kitchen to the bathroom door with a towel.]
BLANCHE:
What's the matter, honey?
STELLA:
Matter? Why?
BLANCHE:
You have such a strange expression on your face!
STELLA:
Oh--[She tries to laugh] I guess I'm a little tired!
BLANCHE:
Why dont you bathe, too, soon as I get out?
STANLEY [calling from the kitchen]:
How soon is that going to be?
BLANCHE:
Not so terribly long! Possess your soul in patience!
STANLEY:
It's not my soul, it's my kidneys I'm worried about!
[Blanche slams the door. Stanley laughs harshly. Stella comes slowly back into the kitchen.]
STANLEY:
Well, what do you think of it?
STELLA:
I dont believe all of those stories and I think your supply-man was mean and rotten to tell them.
It's possible that some of the things he said are partly true. There are things about my sister I
don't approve of--things that caused sorrow at home. She was always--flighty!
STANLEY:
Flighty!
STELLA; But when she was young, very young, she married a boy who wrote poetry.... He was
extremely good-looking. I think Blanche didn't just love him but worshipped the
ground he walked on! Adored him and thought him almost too fine to be human! But then she
found out--
STANLEY:
What?
STELLA:
This beautiful and talented young man was a degenerate. Didn't your supply-man give you that
information?
STANLEY:
All we discussed was recent history. That must have been a pretty long time ago.
STELLA:
Yes, it was--a pretty long time ago....
[Stanley comes up and takes her by the shoulders rather gently. She gently withdraws from him.
Automatically she starts sticking little pink candles in the birthday cake.]
STANLEY:
How many candles you putting in that cake?
STELLA:
I'll stop at twenty-five.
STANLEY:
Is company expected?
STELLA:
We asked Mitch to come over for cake and ice cream.
[Stanley looks a little uncomfortable. He lights a cigarette from the one he has just finished.]
STANLEY:
I wouldn't be expecting Mitch over tonight.
[Stella pauses in her occupation with candles and looks slowly around at Stanley.]
STELLA:
Why?
STANLEY:
Mitch is a buddy of mine. We were in the same outfit together--Two-forty-first Engineers. We
work in the same plant and now on the same bowling team. You think I could face him if--
STELLA:
Stanley Kowalski, did you--did you repeat what that--?
STANLEY:
You're goddam right I told him! I'd have that on my conscience the rest of my life if I knew all
that stuff and let my best friend get caught!
STELLA:
Is Mitch through with her?
STANLEY:
Wouldn't you be if--?
STELLA:
I said, Is Mitch through with her?
[Blanche's voice is lifted again, serenely as a bell. She sings "But it wouldn't be make-believe if
you believed in me."]
STANLEY:
No, I don't think he's necessarily through with her--just wised up!
STELLA:
Stanley, she thought Mitch was--going to--going to marry her. I was hoping so, too.
STANLEY:
Well, he's not going to marry her. Maybe he was, but he's not going to jump in a tank with a
school of sharks--now!
[He rises]
Blanche! Oh, Blanche! Can I please get in my bathroom?
[There is a pause.]
BLANCHE:
Yes, indeed, sir! Can you wait one second while I dry?
STANLEY:
Having waited one hour I guess one second ought to pass in a hurry.
STELLA:
And she hasn't got her job? Well, what will she do!
STANLEY:
She's not stayin' here after Tuesday. You know that, don't you? Just to make sure I bought her
ticket myself. A bus ticket!
STELLA:
In the first place, Blanche wouldn't go on a bus.
STANLEY:
She'll go on a bus and like it.
STELLA:
No, she won't, no, she won't, Stanley!
STANLEY:
She'll go! Period. P.S. She'll go Tuesday!
STELLA [slowly]:
What'll--she--do? What on earth will she--do!
STANLEY:
Her future is mapped out for her.
STELLA:
What do you mean?
[Blanche sings.]
STANLEY:
Hey, canary bird! Toots! Get OUT of the BATHROOM!
[The bathroom door flies open and Blanche emerges with a gay peal of laughter, but as Stanley
crosses past her, a frightened look appears on her face, almost a look of panic. He doesn't look at
her but slams the bathroom door shut as he goes in.]
BLANCHE [snatching up a hairbrush]:
Oh, I feel so good after my long, hot bath, I feel so good and cool and--rested!
STELLA [sadly and doubtfully from the kitchen]:
Do you, Blanche?
BLANCHE [brushing her hair vigorously]:
Yes, I do, so refreshed!
[She tinkles her highball glass.]
A hot bath and a long, cold drink always give me a brand new outlook on life!
[She looks through the portieres at Stella, standing between them, and slowly stops brushing]
Something has happened!--What is it?
STELLA [fuming away quickly]:
Why, nothing has happened, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
You're lying! Something has!
[She stares fearfully at Stella, who pretends to be busy at the table. The distant piano goes into a
hectic breakdown.]
SCENE EIGHT
Three-quarters of an hour later. The view through the big windows is fading gradually into a
still-golden dusk. A torch of sunlight blazes on the side of a big water-tank or oil-drum across the
empty lot toward the business district which is now pierced by pinpoints of lighted windows or
windows reflecting the sunset. The three people are completing a dismal birthday supper. Stanley
looks sullen. Stella is embarrassed and sad. Blanche has a tight, artificial smile on her drawn
face. There is a fourth place at the table which is left vacant.
BLANCHE [suddenly]:
Stanley, tell us a joke, tell us a funny story to make us all laugh. I don't know what's the matter,
we're all so solemn. Is it because I've been stood up by my beau?
[Stella laughs feebly.]
It's the first time in my entire experience with men, and I've had a good deal of all sorts, that I've
actually been stood up by anybody! Ha-ha! I don't know how to take it.... Tell us a funny little
story, Stanley! Something to help us out.
STANLEY:
I didn't think you liked my stories, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I like them when they're amusing but not indecent.
STANLEY:
I don't know any refined enough for your taste.
BLANCHE:
Then let me tell one.
STELLA:
Yes, you tell one, Blanche. You used to know lots of good stories.
[The music fades.]
BLANCHE:
Let me see, now... I must run through my repertoire! Oh. yes--I love parrot stories! Do you all
like parrot stories? Well, this one's about the old maid and the parrot. This old maid, she had a
parrot that cursed a blue streak and knew more vulgar expressions than Mr. Kowalski!
STANLEY:
Huh.
BLANCHE:
And the only way to hush the parrot up was to put the cover back on its cage so it would think it
was night and go back to sleep. Well, one morning the old maid had just uncovered the parrot for
the day--when who should she see coming up the front walk but the preacher! Well, she rushed
back to the parrot and slipped the cover back on the cage and then she let in the preacher. And
the parrot was perfectly still, just as quiet as a mouse, but just as she was asking the preacher
how much sugar he wanted in his coffee--the parrot broke the silence with a loud--[She
whistles]--and said--"God damn, but that was a short day!"
[She throws back her head and laughs. Stella also makes an ineffectual effort to seem amused.
Stanley pays no attention to the story but reaches way aver the table to spear his fork into the
remaining chop which he eats with his fingers.]
BLANCHE:
Apparently Mr. Kowalski was not amused.
STELLA:
Mr. Kowalski is too busy making a pig of himself to think of anything else!
STANLEY:
That's right, baby.
STELLA:
Your face and your fingers are disgustingly greasy. Go and wash up and then help me clear the
table.
[He hurls a plate to the floor.]
STANLEY:
That's how I'll clear the table!
[He seizes her arm]
Don't ever talk that way to me! "Pig--Polack--disgusting--vulgar--greasy!"--them kind of words
have been on your tongue and your sister's too much around here! What do you two think you
are? A pair of queens? Remember what Huey Long said--"Every Man is a King!" And I am the
king around here, so don't forget it!
[He hurls a cup and saucer to the floor]
My place is cleared! You want me to clear your places?
[Stella begins to cry weakly. Stanley stalks out on the porch and lights a cigarette.
[The Negro entertainers around the corner are heard.]
BLANCHE:
What happened while I was bathing? What did he tell you, Stella?
STELLA:
Nothing, nothing, nothing!
BLANCHE:
I think he told you something about Mitch and me! You know why Mitch didn't come but you
won't tell me!
[Stella shakes her head helplessly]
I'm going to call him!
STELLA:
I wouldn't call him, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I am, I'm going to call him on the phone.
STELLA [miserably]:
I wish you wouldn't
BLANCHE:
I intend to be given some explanation from someone!
[She rushes to the phone in the bedroom. Stella goes out on the porch and stares reproachfully at
her husband. He grunts and turns away from her.]
STELLA:
I hope you're pleased with your doings. I never had so much trouble swallowing food in my life,
looking at that girl's face and the empty chair!
[She cries quietly.]
BLANCHE [at the phone]:
Hello. Mr. Mitchell, please.... Oh.... I would like to leave a number if I may. Magnolia 9047. And
say it's important to call.... Yes, very important.... Thank you.
[She remains by the phone with a lost, frightened look.]
[Stanley turns slowly back toward his wife and takes her clumsily in his arms.]
STANLEY:
Stell, it's gonna be all right after she goes and after you've had the baby. It's gonna be all right
again between you and me the way that it was. You remember that way that it was? Them nights
we had together? God, honey, it's gonna be sweet when we can make noise in the night the way
that we used to and get the colored lights going with nobody's sister behind the curtains to hear
us!
[Their upstairs neighbors are heard in bellowing laughter at something. Stanley chuckles.] Steve
an' Eunice...
STELLA:
Come on back in.
[She returns to the kitchen and starts lighting the candles on the white cake.]
Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Yes.
[She returns from the bedroom to the table in the kitchen.]
Oh, those pretty little candles! Oh, don't burn them, Stella.
STELLA:
I certainly will.
[Stanley comes back in.]
BLANCHE:
You ought to save them for baby's birthdays. Oh, I hope candles are going to glow in his life and
I hope that his eyes are going to be like candles, like two blue candles lighted in a white cake!
STANLEY [sitting down]:
What poetry!
BLANCHE [she pauses reflectively for a moment]:
I shouldn't have called him.
STELLA:
There's lots of things could have happened.
BLANCHE:
There's no excuse for it, Stella. I don't have to put up with insults. I won't be taken for granted.
STANLEY:
Goddam, it's hot in here with the steam from the bathroom.
BLANCHE:
I've said I was sorry three times.
[The piano fades out.]
I take hot baths for my nerves. Hydro-therapy, they call it. You healthy Polack, without a nerve
in your body, of course you don't know what anxiety feels like!
STANLEY:
I am not a Polack. People from Poland are Poles, not Polacks. But what I am is a one hundred
percent American, born and raised in the greatest country on earth and proud as hell of it, so
don't ever call me a Polack.
[The phone rings. Blanche rises expectantly.]
BLANCHE:
Oh, that's for me, I'm sure.
STANLEY:
I'm not sure. Keep your seat
[He crosses leisurely to phone.]
H'lo. Aw, yeh, hello, Mac.
[He leans against wall, staring insultingly in at Blanche. She sinks back in her chair with a
frightened look. Stella leans over and touches her shoulder.]
BLANCHE:
Oh, keep your hands on me, Stella. What is the matter with you? Why do you look at me with
that pitying look?
STANLEY [bawling]:
QUIET IN THERE!--We've got a noisy woman on the place.--Go on, Mac. At Riley's? No, I
don't wanta bowl at Riley's. I had a little trouble with Riley last week. I'm the team-captain, ain't
I? All right, then, we're not gonna bowl at Riley's, we're gonna bowl at the West Side or the
Gala! All right, Mac. See you!
[He hangs up and returns to the table. Blanche fiercely controls herself, drinking quickly from
her tumbler of water. He doesn't look at her but reaches in a pocket. Then he speaks slowly and
with false amiability.] Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you.
BLANCHE:
Oh, have you, Stanley? I wasn't expecting any, I--I don't know why Stella wants to observe my
birthday! I'd much rather forget it--when you--reach twenty-seven! Well--age is a subject that
you'd prefer to--ignore!
STANLEY:
Twenty-seven?
BLANCHE [quickly]:
What is it? Is it for me?
[He is holding a little envelope toward her.]
STANLEY:
Yes, I hope you like it!
BLANCHE:
Why, why--Why, it's a--
STANLEY:
Ticket! Back to Laurel! On the Greyhound! Tuesday!
[The Varsouviana music steals in softly and continues playing. Stella rises abruptly and turns her
back. Blanche tries to smile. Then she tries to laugh. Then she
gives both up and springs from the table and runs into the next room. She clutches her throat and
then runs into the bathroom. Coughing, gagging sounds are heard.]
Well!
STELLA:
You didn't need to do that.
STANLEY:
Don't forget all that I took off her.
STELLA:
You needn't have been so cruel to someone alone as she is.
STANLEY:
Delicate piece she is.
STELLA:
She is. She was. You didn't know Blanche as a girl. Nobody, nobody, was tender and trusting as
she was. But people like you abused her, and forced her to change.
[He crosses into the bedroom, ripping off his shirt, and changes into a brilliant silk bowling shirt.
She follows him.]
Do you think you're going bowling now?
STANLEY:
Sure.
STELLA:
You're not going bowling.
[She catches hold of his shirt]
Why did you do this to her?
STANLEY:
I done nothing to no one. Let go of my shirt. You've torn it
STELLA:
I want to know why. Tell me why.
STANLEY:
When we first met, me and you, you thought I was common. How right you was, baby. I was
common as dirt. You showed me the snapshot of the place with the columns. I pulled
you down off them columns and how you loved it, having them colored lights going! And wasn't
we happy together, wasn't it all okay till she showed here?
[Stella makes a slight movement. Her look goes suddenly inward as if some interior voice had
called her name. She begins a slow, shuffling progress from the bedroom to the kitchen, leaning
and resting on the back of the chair and then on the edge of a table with a blind look and
listening expression. Stanley, finishing with his shirt, is unaware of her reaction.]
And wasn't we happy together? Wasn't it all okay? Till she showed here. Hoity-toity, describing
me as an ape.
[He suddenly notices the change in Stella]
Hey, what is it, Stella?
[He crosses to her.]
STELLA [quietly]:
Take me to the hospital.
[He is with her now, supporting her with his arm, murmuring indistinguishably as they go
outside.]
SCENE NINE
A while later that evening--Blanche is seated in a tense hunched position in a bedroom chair that
she has re-covered with diagonal green-and-white stripes. She has on her scarlet satin robe. On
the table beside chair is a bottle of liquor and a glass. The rapid, feverish polka tune, the
"Varsouviana," is heard. The music is in her mind; she is drinking to escape it and the sense of
disaster closing in on her, and she seems to whisper the words of the song. An electric fan is
turning back and forth across her. Mitch comes around the corner in work clothes: blue denim
shirt and pants. He is unshaven. He climbs the steps to the door and rings. Blanche is startled.
BLANCHE:
Who is it, please?
MITCH [hoarsely]:
Me. Mitch.
[The polka tune stops.]
BLANCHE:
Mitch!--just a minute.
[She rushes about frantically, hiding the bottle in a closet, crouching at the mirror and dabbing
her face with cologne and powder. She is so excited her breath is audible as she dashes about. At
last she rushes to the door in the kitchen and lets him in.]
Mitch!--Y'know, I really shouldn't let you in after the treatment I have received from you this
evening! So utterly uncavalier! But hello, beautiful!
[She offers him her lips. He ignores it and pushes past her into the flat. She looks fearfully after
him as he stalks into the bedroom.]
My, my, what a cold shoulder! And such uncouth apparel! Why, you haven't even shaved! The
unforgivable insult to a lady! But I forgive you. I forgive you because it's such a relief to see you.
You've stopped that polka tune that I had caught in my head. Have you ever had anything caught
in your head? No, of course you haven't, you dumb angel-puss, you'd never get anything awful
caught in your head!
[He stares at her while she follows him while she talks. It is obvious that he has had a few drinks
on the way over.]
MITCH:
Do we have to have that fan on?
BLANCHE:
No!
MITCH:
I don't like fans.
BLANCHE:
Then let's turn it off, honey. I'm not partial to them!
[She presses the switch and the fan nods slowly off. She clears her throat uneasily as Mitch
plumps himself down on the bed in the bedroom and lights a cigarette.] I don't know what there
is to drink. I--haven't investigated.
MITCH:
I don't want Stan's liquor.
BLANCHE:
It isn't Stan's. Everything here isn't Stan's. Some things on the premises are actually mine! How
is your mother? Isn't your mother well?
MITCH:
Why?
BLANCHE:
Something's the matter tonight, but never mind. I won't cross-examine the witness. I'll just--[She
touches her forehead vaguely. The polka tune starts up again.]--pretend I don't notice anything
different about you! That--music again...
MITCH:
What music?
BLANCHE:
The "Varaouviana"! The polka tune they were playing when Allan--Wait!
[A distant revolver shot is heard. Blanche seems relieved.] There now, the shot! It always stops
after that.
[The polka music dies out again.]
Yes, now it's stopped.
MITCH:
Are you boxed out of your mind?
BLANCHE:
I'll go and see what I can find in the way of--[She crosses into the closet, pretending to search for
the bottle.]
Oh, by the way, excuse me for not being dressed. But I'd practically given you up! Had you
forgotten your invitation to supper?
MITCH:
I wasn't going to see you any more.
BLANCHE:
Wait a minute. I can't hear what you're saying and you talk so little that when you do say
something, I don't want to miss a single syllable of it.... What am I looking around here for? Oh,
yes--liquor! We've had so much excitement around here this evening that I am boxed out of my
mind!
[She pretends suddenly to find the bottle. He draws his foot up on the bed and stares at her
contemptuously. Here's something. Southern Comfort! What is that, I wonder?
MITCH:
If you don't know, it must belong to Stan.
BLANCHE:
Take your foot off the bed. It has a light cover on it. Of course you boys don't notice things like
that. I've done so much with this place since I've been here.
MITCH:
I bet you have.
BLANCHE:
You saw it before I came. Well, look at it now! This room is almost--dainty! I want to keep it
that way. I wonder if this stuff ought to be mixed with something? Ummm, it's sweet, so sweet!
It's terribly, terribly sweet! Why, it's a liqueur, I believe! Yes, that's what it is, a liqueur!
[Mitch grunts.]
I'm afraid you won't like it, but try it, and maybe you will.
MITCH:
I told you already I don't want none of his liquor and I mean it. You ought to lay off his liquor.
He says you been lapping it up all summer like a wildcat!
BLANCHE:
What a fantastic statement! Fantastic of him to say it, fantastic of you to repeat it! I won't
descend to the level of such cheap accusations to answer them, even!
MITCH:
Huh.
BLANCHE:
What's in your mind? I see something in your eyes!
MITCH [getting up]:
It's dark in here.
BLANCHE:
I like it dark. The dark is comforting to me.
MITCH:
I don't think I ever seen you in the light.
[Blanche laughs breathlessly]
That's a fact!
BLANCHE:
Is it?
MITCH:
I've never seen you in the afternoon.
BLANCHE:
Whose fault is that?
MITCH:
You never want to go out in the afternoon.
BLANCHE:
Why, Mitch, you're at the plant in the afternoon!
MITCH:
Not Sunday afternoon. I've asked you to go out with me sometimes on Sundays but you always
make an excuse. You never want to go out till after six and then it's always some place that's not
lighted much.
BLANCHE:
There is some obscure meaning in this but I fail to catch it.
MITCH:
What it means is I've never had a real good look at you, Blanche. Let's turn the light on here.
BLANCHE [fearfully]:
Light? Which light? What for?
MITCH:
This one with the paper thing on it.
[He tears the paper lantern off the light bulb. She utters a frightened gasp.]
BLANCHE:
What did you do that for?
MITCH:
So I can take a look at you good and plain!
BLANCHE:
Of course you don't really mean to be insulting!
MITCH:
No, just realistic.
BLANCHE:
I don't want realism. I want magic!
[Mitch laughs]
Yes, yes, magic! I try to give that to people. I misrepresent things to them. I don't tell truth, I tell
what ought to be truth. And if that is sinful, then let me be damned for it!--Don't turn the light
on!
[Mitch crosses to the switch. He turns the light on and stares at her. She cries out and covers her
face. He turns the light off again.]
MITCH [slowly and bitterly]:
I don't mind you being older than what I thought. But all the rest of it--Christ! That pitch about
your ideals being so old-fashioned and all the malarkey that you've dished out all summer. Oh, I
knew you weren't sixteen any more. But I was a fool enough to believe you was straight.
BLANCHE:
Who told you I wasn't--'straight'? My loving brother-in-law. And you believed him.
MITCH:
I called him a liar at first And then I checked on the story. First I asked our supply-man who
travels through Laure. And then I talked directly over long-distance to this merchant
BLANCHE:
Who is this merchant?
MITCH:
Kiefaber.
BLANCHE:
The merchant Kiefaber of Laurel! I know the man. He whistled at me. I put him in his place. So
now for revenge he makes up stories about me.
MITCH:
Three people, Kiefaber, Stanley and Shaw, swore to them!
BLANCHE:
Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub! And such a filthy tub!
MITCH:
Didn't you stay at a hotel called the Flamingo?
BLANCHE:
Flamingo? No! Tarantula was the name of it! I stayed at a hotel called the Tarantula Arms!
MITCH [stupidly]:
Tarantula?
BLANCHE:
Yes, a big spider! That's where I brought my victims.
[She pours herself another drink]
Yes, I had many intimacies with strangers. After the death of Allan--intimacies with strangers
was all I seemed able to fill my empty heart with.... I think it was panic, just panic, that drove me
from one to another, hunting for some protection--here and there, in the most--unlikely places--
even, at last, in a seventeen-year-old boy but--somebody wrote the superintendent about it--"This
woman is morally unfit for her position!"
[She throws back her head with convulsive, sobbing laughter. Then she repeats the statement,
gasps, and drinks.]
True? Yes, I suppose--unfit somehow--anyway... So I came here. There was nowhere else I
could go. I was played out. You know what played out is? My youth was suddenly gone up the
water-spout, and--I met you. You said you needed somebody. Well, I needed somebody, too. I
thanked God for you, because you seemed to be gentle--a cleft in the rock of the world that I
could hide in! But I guess I was asking, hoping--too much! Kiefaber, Stanley and Shaw have tied
an old tin can to the tail of the kite.
[There is a pause. Mitch stares at her dumbly.]
MITCH:
You lied to me, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
Don't say I lied to you.
MITCH:
Lies, lies, inside and out, all lies.
BLANCHE:
Never inside, I didn't lie in my heart....
[A Vendor comes around the corner. She is a blind Mexican woman in a dark shawl, carrying
bunches of those gaudy tin flowers that lower class Mexicans display at funerals and other
festive occasions. She is calling barely audibly. Her figure is only faintly visible outside the
building.]
MEXICAN WOMAN:
Flores. Flores. Flores para los muertos. Flores. Flores.
BLANCHE:
What? Oh! Somebody outside...
[She goes to the door. opens it and stares at the Mexican Woman.]
MEXICAN WOMAN [she is at the door and offers Blanche some of her flowers]:
Flores? Flores para los muertos?
BLANCHE [frightened]: No, no! Not now! Not now!
[She darts back into the apartment, slamming the door.]
MEXICAN WOMAN [she turns away and starts to move down the street]:
Flores para los muertos.
[The polka tune fades in.]
BLANCHE [as if to herself]:
Crumble and fade and--regrets--recriminations... "If you'd done this, it wouldn't've cost me that!"
MEXICAN WOMAN:
Corones para los muertos. Corones...
BLANCHE:
Legacies! Huh... And other things such as bloodstained pillow-slips--"Her linen needs
changing"--"Yes Mother." But couldn't we get a colored girl to do it?" No, we couldn't of course.
Everything gone but the--
MEXICAN WOMAN:
Flores,
BLANCHE:
Death--I used to sit here and she used to sit over there and death was as close as you are.... We
didn't dare even admit we had ever heard of it!
MEXICAN WOMAN:
Flores para los muertos, flores--flores...
BLANCHE:
The opposite is desire. So do you wonder? How could you possibly wonder! Not far from Belle
Reve, before we had lost Belle Reve, was a camp where they trained young soldiers. On
Saturday nights they would go in town to get drunk--
MEXICAN WOMAN [softly]:
Corones...
BLANCHE:
--and on the way back they would stagger onto my lawn and call--"Blanche! Blanche!"--The
deaf old lady remaining suspected nothing. But sometimes I slipped outside to answer their
calls.... Later the paddy-wagon would gather them up like daisies... the long way home....
[The Mexican Woman turns slowly and drifts back off with her soft mournful cries. Blanche
goes to the dresser and leans forward on it. After a moment, Mitch rises and follows her
purposefully. The polka music fades away. He places his hands on her waist and tries to turn her
about.]
BLANCHE:
What do you want?
MITCH [fumbling to embrace her]:
What I been missing all summer.
BLANCHE:
Then marry me, Mitch!
MITCH:
I don't think I want to marry you any more.
BLANCHE:
No?
MITCH [dropping his hands from her waist]:
You're not clean enough to bring in the house with my mother.
BLANCHE:
Go away, then.
[He stares at her]
Get out of here quick before I start screaming fire!
[Her throat is tightening with hysteria]
Get out of here quick before I start screaming fire.
[He still remains staring. She suddenly rushes to the big window with its pale blue square of the
soft summer light and cries wildly.]
Fire! Fire! Fire!
[With a startled, gasp, Mitch turns and goes out the outer door, clatters awkwardly down the
steps and around the corner of the building, Blanche staggers back from the window and falls to
her knees. The distant piano is slow and blue.]
SCENE TEN
It is a few hows later that night. Blanche has been drinking fairly steadily since Mitch left. She
has dragged her wardrobe trunk into the center of the bedroom. It hangs open with flowery
dresses thrown across it. As the drinking and packing went on, a mood of hysterical exhilaration
came into her and she has decked herself out in a somewhat soiled and crumpled white satin
evening gown and a pair of scuffed silver slippers with brilliants set in their heels. Now she is
placing the rhinestone tiara on her head before the mirror of the dressing-table and murmuring
excitedly as if to a group of spectral admirers.
BLANCHE:
How about taking a swim, a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry? If anyone's sober enough to
drive a car! Ha-ha! Best way in the world to stop your head buzzing! Only you've got to be
careful to dive where the deep pool is--if you hit a rock you don't come up till tomorrow....
[Tremblingly she lifts the hand mirror for a closer inspection. She catches her breath and slams
the mirror face down with such violence that the glass cracks. She moans a little and attempts to
rise.
[Stanley appears around the corner of the building. He still has on the vivid green silk bowling
shirt. As he rounds the corner the honky-tonk music is heard. It continues softly throughout the
scene.
[He enters the kitchen, slamming the door. As he peers in at Blanche, he gives a low whistle. He
has had a few drinks on the way and has brought some quart beer bottles home with him.]
BLANCHE:
How is my sister?
STANLEY:
She is doing okay.
BLANCHE:
And how is the baby?
STANLEY [grinning amiably]:
The baby won't come before morning so they told me to go home and get a little shuteye.
BLANCHE:
Does that mean we are to be alone in here?
STANLEY:
Yep. Just me and you, Blanche. Unless you got somebody hid under the bed. What've you got on
those fine feathers for?
BLANCHE:
Oh, that's right. You left before my wire came.
STANLEY:
You got a wire?
BLANCHE:
I received a telegram from an old admirer of mine.
STANLEY:
Anything good?
BLANCHE:
I think so. An invitation.
STANLEY:
What to? A fireman's ball?
BLANCHE [throwing back her head]:
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht!
STANLEY:
Well, well. What do you know?
BLANCHE:
I have never been so surprised in my life.
STANLEY:
I guess not.
BLANCHE:
It came like a bolt from the blue!
STANLEY:
Who did you say it was from?
BLANCHE:
An old beau of mine.
STANLEY:
The one that give you the white fox-pieces?
BLANCHE:
Mr. Shep Huntleigh. I wore his ATO pin my last year at college. I hadn't seen him again until
last Christmas. I ran into him on Biscayne Boulevard. Then--just now--this wire--inviting me on
a cruise of the Caribbean! The problem is clothes. I tore into my trunk to see what I have that's
suitable for the tropics!
STANLEY:
And come up with that--gorgeous--diamond--tiara?
BLANCHE:
This old relic? Ha-ha! It's only rhinestones.
STANLEY:
Gosh. I thought it was Tiffany diamonds.
[He unbuttons his shirt.]
BLANCHE:
Well, anyhow, I shall be entertained in style.
STANLEY:
Uh-huh. It goes to show, you never know what is coming.
BLANCHE:
Just when I thought my luck had begun to fail me--
STANLEY:
Into the picture pops this Miami millionaire.
BLANCHE:
This man is not from Miami. This man is from Dallas.
STANLEY:
This man is from Dallas?
BLANCHE:
Yes, this man is from Dallas where gold spouts out of the ground!
STANLEY:
Well, just so he's from somewhere!
[He starts removing his shirt.]
BLANCHE:
Close the curtains before you undress any further.
STANLEY [amiably]:
This is all I'm going to undress right now.
[He rips the sack off a quart beer bottle]
Seen a bottle opener?
[She moves slowly toward the dresser, where she stands with her hands knotted together.]
I used to have a cousin who could open a beer bottle with his teeth.
[Pounding the bottle cap on the corner of table]
That was his only accomplishment, all he could do--he was just a human bottle-opener. And then
one time, at a wedding party, he broke his front teeth off! After that he was so ashamed of
himself he used t' sneak out of the house when company came....
[The bottle cap pops off and a geyser of foam shoots up. Stanley laughs happily, holding up the
bottle over his head.]
Ha-ha! Rain from heaven!
[He extends the bottle toward her]
Shall we bury the hatchet and make it a loving-cup? Huh?
BLANCHE:
No, thank you.
STANLEY:
Well, it's a red letter night for us both. You having an oil millionaire and me having a baby.
[He goes to the bureau in the bedroom and crouches to remove something from the bottom
drawer.]
BLANCHE [drawing back]:
What are you doing in here?
STANLEY:
Here's something I always break out on special occasions like this. The silk pyjamas I wore on
my wedding night!
BLANCHE:
Oh.
STANLEY:
When the telephone rings and they say, "You've got a son!" Ill tear this off and wave it like a
flag!
[He shakes out a brilliant pyjama coat]
I guess we are both entitled to put on the dog.
[He goes back to the kitchen with the coat over his arm.]
BLANCHE:
When I think of how divine it is going to be to have such a thing as privacy once more--I could
weep with joy!
STANLEY:
This millionaire from Dallas is not going to interfere with your privacy any?
BLANCHE:
It won't be the sort of thing you have in mind. This man is a gentleman and he respects me.
[Improvising feverishly]
What he wants is my companionship. Having great wealth sometimes makes people lonely! A
cultivated woman, a woman of intelligence and breeding, can enrich a man's life--immeasurably!
I have those things to offer, and this doesn't take them away. Physical beauty is passing. A
transitory possession. But beauty of the mind and richness of the spirit and tenderness of the
heart--and I have all of those things--aren't taken away, but grow! Increase with the years! How
strange that I should be called a destitute woman! When I have all of these treasures locked in
my heart.
[A choked sob comes from her]
I think of myself as a very, very rich woman! But I have been foolish--casting my pearls before
swine!
STANLEY:
Swine, huh?
BLANCHE:
Yes, swine! Swine! And I'm thinking not only of you but of your friend, Mr. Mitchell. He came
to see me tonight. He dared to come here in his work-clothes! And to repeat slander to me,
vicious stories that he had gotten from you! I gave him his walking papers....
STANLEY:
You did, huh?
BLANCHE:
But then he came back. He returned with a box of roses to beg my forgiveness! He implored my
forgiveness. But some things are not forgivable. Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable. It is the one
unforgivable thing in my opinion and it is the one thing of which I have never, never been guilty.
And so I told him, I said to him, "Thank you," but it was foolish of me to think that we could
ever adapt ourselves to each other. Our ways of life are too different. Our attitudes and our
backgrounds are incompatible. We have to be realistic about such things. So farewell, my friend!
And let there be no hard feelings....
STANLEY:
Was this before or after the telegram came from the Texas oil millionaire?
BLANCHE:
What telegram! No! No, after! As a matter of fact, the wire came just as--
STANLEY:
As a matter of fact there wasn't no wire at all!
BLANCHE:
Oh, oh!
STANLEY:
There isn't no millionaire! And Mitch didn't come back; with roses 'cause I know where he is--
BLANCHE:
Oh!
STANLEY:
There isn't a goddam thing but imagination!
BLANCHE:
Oh!
STANLEY:
And lies and conceit and tricks!
BLANCHE:
Oh!
STANLEY:
And look at yourself! Take a look at yourself in that wornout Mardi Gras outfit, rented for fifty
cents from some ragpicker! And with the crazy crown on! What queen do you think you are?
BLANCHE:
Oh--God...
STANLEY:
I've been on to you from the start! Not once did you pull any wool over this boy's eyes! You
come in here and sprinkle the place with powder and spray perfume and cover the light bulb with
a paper lantern, and lo and behold the place has turned into Egypt and you are the Queen of the
Nile! Sitting on your throne and swilling down my liquor! I say--Ha!--Ha! Do you hear me? Ha--
ha--ha!
[He walks into the bedroom.]
BLANCHE:
Don't come in here!
[Lurid reflections appear on the wall around Blanche. The shadows are of a grotesque and
menacing form. She catches her breath, crosses to the phone and jiggles the hook. Stanley goes
into the bathroom and closes the door.]
Operator, operator! Give me long-distance, please.... I want to get in touch with Mr. Shep
Huntleigh of Dallas. He's so well-known he doesn't require any address. Just ask anybody who--
Wait! I--No, I couldn't find it right now.... Please understand, I--No! No, wait! ... One moment!
Someone is--Nothing! Hold on, please!
[She sets the phone down and crosses warily into the kitchen. The night is filled with inhuman
voices like cries in a jungle.
[The shadows and lurid reflections move sinously as flames along the wall spaces.
[Through the back wall of the rooms, which have become transparent, can be seen the sidewalk.
A prostitute has rolled a drunkard. He pursues her along the walk, overtakes her and there is a
struggle. A policeman's whistle breaks it up. The figures disappear.
[Some moments later the Negro Woman appears around the corner with a sequined bag which
the prostitute had dropped on the walk. She is rooting excitedly through it.]
[Blanche presses her knuckles to her lips and returns slowly to the phone. She speaks in a hoarse
whisper.]
BLANCHE:
Operator! Operator! Never mind long-distance. Get Western Union. There isn't time to be--
Western--Western Union!
[She waits anxiously.]
Western Union? Yes! I--want to--Take down this message! "In desperate, desperate
circumstances! Help me! Caught in a trap. Caught in--" Oh!
[The bathroom door is thrown open and Stanley comes out in the brilliant silk pyjamas. He grins
at her as he knots the tasseled sash about his waist. She gasps and backs away from the phone.
He stares at her for a count of ten. Then a clicking becomes audible from the telephone, steady
and rasping.]
STANLEY:
You left th' phone off th' hook.
[He crosses to it deliberately and sets it back on the hook. After he has replaced it, he stares at
her again, his mouth slowly curving into a grin, as he weaves between Blanche and the outer
door.
[The barely audible "blue piano" begins to drum up louder. The sound of it turns into the roar of
an approaching locomotive. Blanche crouches, pressing her fists to her ears until it has gone by.]
BLANCHE [finally straightening]:
Let me--let me get by you!
STANLEY:
Get by me! Sure. Go ahead.
[He moves back a pace in the doorway.]
BLANCHE:
You--you stand over there!
[She indicates a further position.]
STANLEY [grinning]:
You got plenty of room to walk by me now.
BLANCHE:
Not with you there! But I've got to get out somehow!
STANLEY:
You think I'll interfere with you? Ha-ha!
[The "blue piano" goes softly. She turns confusedly and makes a faint gesture. The inhuman
jungle voices rise up. He takes a step toward her, biting his tongue which protrudes between his
lips.]
STANLEY [softly]:
Come to think of it--maybe you wouldn't be bad to--interfere with....
[Blanche moves backward through the door into the bedroom.]
BLANCHE:
Stay back! Don't you come toward me another step or I'll--
STANLEY:
What?
BLANCHE:
Some awful thing will happen! It will!
STANLEY:
What are you putting on now?
[They are now both inside the bedroom.]
BLANCHE:
I warn you, don't, I'm in danger!
[He takes another step. She smashes a bottle on the table and faces him, clutching the broken
top.]
STANLEY:
What did you do that for?
BLANCHE:
So I could twist the broken end in your face!
STANLEY:
I bet you would do that!
BLANCHE:
I would! I will if you--
STANLEY:
Oh! So you want some rough-house! All right, let's have some rough-house!
[He springs toward her, overturning the table. She cries out and strikes at him with the bottle top
but he catches her wrist.]
Tiger--tiger! Drop the bottle top! Drop it! We've had this date with each other from the
beginning!
[She moans. The bottle top falls. She sinks to her knees. He picks up her inert figure and carries
her to the bed. The hot trumpet and drums from the Four Deuces sound loudly.]
SCENE ELEVEN
It is some weeks later. Stella is packing Blanche's things. Sounds of water can be heard running
in the bathroom. The portieres are partly open on the poker players--Stanley, Steve, Mitch and
Pablo--who sit around the table in the kitchen. The atmosphere of the kitchen is now the same
raw, lurid one of the disastrous poker night. The building is framed by the sky of turquoise.
Stella has been crying as she arranges the flowery dresses in the open trunk. Eunice comes down
the steps from her flat above and enters the kitchen. There is an outburst from the poker table.
STANLEY:
Drew to an inside straight and made it, by God.
PABLO:
Maldita sea to suerte!
STANLEY:
Put it in English, greaseball!
PABLO:
I am cursing your rutting luck.
STANLEY [prodigiously elated]:
You know what luck is? Luck is believing you're lucky. Take at Salerno. I believed I was lucky.
I figured that 4 out of 5 would not come through but I would... and I did. I put that down as a
rule. To hold front position in this rat-race you've got to believe you are lucky.
MITCH:
You... you... you... Brag... brag... bull... bull.
[Stella goes into the bedroom and starts folding a dress.]
STANLEY:
What's the matter with him?
EUNICE [walking past the table]:
I always did say that men are callous things with no feelings, but this does beat anything. Making
pigs of yourselves.
[She comes through the portieres into the bedroom.]
STANLEY:
What's the matter with her?
STELLA:
How is my baby?
EUNICE:
Sleeping like a little angel. Brought you some grapes.
[She puts them on a stool and lowers her voice.] Blanche?
STELLA:
Bathing.
EUNICE:
How is she?
STELLA:
She wouldn't eat anything but asked for a drink.
EUNICE:
What did you tell her?
STELLA:
I--just told her that--we'd made arrangements for her to rest in the country. She's got it mixed in
her mind with Shep Huntleigh.
[Blanche opens the bathroom door slightly.]
BLANCHE:
Stella.
STELLA:
Yes, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
If anyone calls while I'm bathing take the number and tell them I'll call right back.
STELLA:
Yes.
BLANCHE:
That cool yellow silk--the boucle. See if it's crushed. If it's not too crushed I'll wear it and on the
lapel that silver and turquoise pin in the shape of a seahorse. You will find them in the heartshaped box I keep my accessories in. And Stella... Try and locate a bunch of artificial violets in
that box, too, to pin with the seahorse on the lapel of the jacket.
[She closes the door. Stella turns to Eunice.]
STELLA:
I don't know if I did the right thing.
EUNICE:
What else could you do?
STELLA:
I couldn't believe her story and go on living with Stanley.
EUNICE:
Don't ever believe it. Life has got to go on. No matter what happens, you've got to keep on going.
[The bathroom door opens a little.]
BLANCHE [looking out]:
Is the coast clear?
STELLA:
Yes, Blanche.
[To Eunice]
Tell her how well she's looking.
BLANCHE:
Please close the curtains before I come out.
STELLA:
They're closed.
STANLEY:
--How many for you?
PABLO:
--Two.
STEVE:
--Three.
[Blanche appears in the amber tight of the door. She has a tragic radiance in her red satin robe
following the sculptural lines of her body. The "Varsouviana" rises audibly as Blanche enters the
bedroom.]
BLANCHE [with faintly hysterical vivacity]:
I have just washed my hair.
STELLA:
Did you?
BLANCHE:
I'm not sure I got the soap out.
EUNICE:
Such fine hair!
BLANCHE [accepting the compliment]:
It's a problem. Didn't I get a call?
STELLA:
Who from, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
Shep Huntleigh....
STELLA:
Why, not yet, honey!
BLANCHE:
How strange! I--
[At the sound of Blanche's voice Mitch's arm supporting his cards has sagged and his gaze is
dissolved into space. Stanley slaps him on the shoulder.]
STANLEY:
Hey, Mitch, come to!
[The sound of this new voice shocks Blanche. She makes a shocked gesture, forming his name
with her lips. Stella nods and looks quickly away. Blanche stands quite still for some moments--
the silver-backed mirror in her hand and a look of sorrowful perplexity as though all human
experience shows on her face. Blanche finally speaks but with sudden hysteria.]
BLANCHE:
What's going on here?
[She turns from Stella to Eunice and back to Stella. Her rising voice penetrates the concentration
of the game. Mitch ducks his head lower but Stanley shoves back his chair as if about to rise.
Steve places a restraining hand on his arm.]
BLANCHE [continuing]:
What's happened here? I want an explanation of what's happened here.
STELLA [agonizingly]:
Hush! Hush!
EUNICE:
Hush! Hush! Honey.
STELLA:
Please, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
Why are you looking at me like that? Is something wrong with me?
EUNICE:
You look wonderful, Blanche. Don't she look wonderful?
STELLA:
Yes.
EUNICE:
I understand you are going on a trip.
STELLA:
Yes, Blanche is. She's going on a vacation.
EUNICE:
I'm green with envy.
BLANCHE:
Help me, help me get dressed!
STELLA [handing her dress]:
Is this what you--
BLANCHE:
Yes, it will do! I'm anxious to get out of here--this place is a trap!
EUNICE:
What a pretty blue jacket.
STELLA:
It's lilac colored.
BLANCHE:
You're both mistaken. It's Delia Robbia blue. The blue of the robe in the old Madonna pictures.
Are these grapes washed?
[She fingers the bunch of grapes which Eunice had brought in.]
EUNICE:
Huh?
BLANCHE:
Washed, I said. Are they washed?
EUNICE:
They're from the French Market.
BLANCHE:
That doesn't mean they've been washed.
[The cathedral bells chime]
Those cathedral bells--they're the only clean thing in the Quarter. Well, I'm going now. I'm ready
to go.
EUNICE [whispering]:
She's going to walk out before they get here.
STELLA:
Wait, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I don't want to pass in front of those men.
EUNICE:
Then wait'll the game breaks up.
STELLA:
Sit down and...
[Blanche turns weakly, hesitantly about. She lets them push her into a chair.]
BLANCHE:
I can smell the sea air. The rest of my time I'm going to spend on the sea. And when I die, I'm
going to die on the sea. You know what I shall die of?
[She plucks a grape]
I shall die of eating an unwashed grape one day out on the ocean. I will die--with my hand in the
hand of some nice-looking ship's doctor, a very young one with a small blond mustache and a
big silver watch. "Poor lady," they'll say, "the quinine did her no good. That unwashed grape has
transported her soul to heaven."
[The cathedral chimes are heard]
And I'll be buried at sea sewn up in a clean white sack and dropped overboard--at noon--in the
blaze of summer--and into an ocean as blue as
[Chimes again]
my first lover's eyes!
[A Doctor and a Matron have appeared around the corner of the building and climbed the steps
to the porch. The gravity of their profession is exaggerated--the unmistakable aura of the state
institution with its cynical detachment. The Doctor rings the doorbell. The murmur of the game
is interrupted.]
EUNICE [whispering to Stella]:
That must be them.
[Stella presses her fists to her lips.]
BLANCHE [rising slowly]:
What is it?
EUNICE [affectedly casual]:
Excuse me while I see who's at the door.
STELLA:
Yes.
[Eunice goes into the kitchen.]
BLANCHE [tensely]:
I wonder if it's for me.
[A whispered colloquy takes place at the door.]
EUNICE [returning, brightly]:
Someone is calling for Blanche.
BLANCHE:
It is for me, then!
[She looks fearfully from one to the other and then to the portieres. The "Varsouviana" faintly
plays]
Is it the gentleman I was expecting from Dallas?
EUNICE:
I think it is, Blanche.
BLANCHE:
I'm not quite ready.
STELLA:
Ask him to wait outside.
BLANCHE:
I...
[Eunice goes back to the portieres. Drums sound very softly.]
STELLA:
Everything packed?
BLANCHE:
My silver toilet articles are still out.
STELLA:
Ah!
EUNICE [returning]:
They're waiting in front of the house.
BLANCHE:
They! Who's "they"?
[The "Varsouviana" is playing distantly.
[Stella stares back at Blanche. Eunice is holding Stella's arm. There is a moment of silence--no
sound but that of Stanley steadily shuffling the cards.]
[Blanche catches her breath again and slips back into the flat with a peculiar smile, her eyes wide
and brilliant. As soon as her sister goes past her, Stella closes her eyes and clenches her hands.
Eunice throws her arms comforting about her. Then she starts up to her flat. Blanche stops just
inside the door. Mitch keeps staring down at his hands on the table, but the other men look at her
curiously. At last she starts around the table toward the bedroom. As she does, Stanley suddenly
pushes back his chair and rises as if to block her way. The Matron follows her into the flat.]
STANLEY:
Did you forget something?
BLANCHE [shrilly]:
Yes! Yes, I forgot something!
[She rushes past him into the bedroom. Lurid reflections appear on the walls in odd, sinuous
shapes. The "Varsouviana" is filtered into a weird distortion, accompanied by the cries and
noises of the jungle. Blanche seizes the back of a chair as if to defend herself.]
STANLEY [sotto voice]:
Doc, you better go in.
DOCTOR [sotto voce, motioning to the Matron]:
Nurse, bring her out
[The Matron advances on one side, Stanley on the other, Divested of all the softer properties of
womanhood, the Matron is a peculiarly sinister figure in her severe dress. Her voice is bold and
toneless as a firebell.]
MATRON:
Hello, Blanche.
[The greeting is echoed and re-echoed by other mysterious voices behind the walls, as if
reverberated through a canyon of rock.]
STANLEY:
She says that she forgot something.
[The echo sounds in threatening whispers.]
MATRON:
That's all right.
STANLEY:
What did you forget, Blanche?
BLANCHE:
I--I--
MATRON:
It don't matter. We can pick it up later.
STANLEY:
Sure. We can send it along with the trunk.
BLANCHE [retreating in panic]:
I don't know you--I don't know you. I want to be--left alone--please!
MATRON:
Now, Blanche!
ECHOES [rising and falling]:
Now, Blanche--now, Blanche--now, Blanche!
STANLEY:
You left nothing here but spilt talcum and old empty perfume bottles--unless it's the paper
lantern you want to take with you. You want the lantern?
[He crosses to dressing table and seizes the paper lantern, tearing it off the light bulb, and
extends it toward her. She cries out as if the lantern was herself. The Matron steps boldly toward
her. She screams and tries to break past the Matron. All the men spring to their feet. Stella runs
out to the porch, with Eunice following to comfort her, simultaneously with the confused voices
of the men in the kitchen. Stella rushes into Eunice's embrace on the porch.]
STELLA:
Oh, my God, Eunice help me! Don't let them do that to her, don't let them hurt her! Oh, God, oh,
please God, don't hurt her! What are they doing to her? What are they doing?
[She tries to break from Eunice's arms.]
EUNICE:
No, honey, no, no, honey. Stay here. Don't go back in there. Stay with me and don't look.
STELLA:
What have I done to my sister? Oh, God, what have I done to my sister?
EUNICE:
You done the right thing, the only thing you could do. She couldn't stay here; there wasn't no
other place for her to go.
[While Stella and Eunice are speaking on the porch the voices of the men in the kitchen overlap
them. Mitch has started toward the bedroom. Stanley crosses to block him. Stanley pushes him
aside. Mitch lunges and strikes at Stanley. Stanley pushes Mitch back. Mitch collapses at the
table, sobbing.
[During the preceding scenes, the Matron catches hold of Blanche's arm and prevents her flight.
Blanche turns wildly and scratches at the Matron. The heavy woman pinions her arms. Blanche
cries out hoarsely and slips to her knees.]
MATRON:
These fingernails have to be trimmed.
[The Doctor comes into the room and she looks at him.]
Jacket, Doctor?
DOCTOR:
Not unless necessary.
[He takes off his hat and now he becomes personalized. The unhuman quality goes. His voice is
gentle and reassuring as he crosses to Blanche and crouches in front of her. As he speaks her
name, her terror subsides a little. The lurid reflections fade from the walls, the inhuman cries and
noises die out and her own hoarse crying is calmed.]
DOCTOR:
Miss DuBois.
[She turns her face to him and stares at him with desperate pleading. He smiles; then he speaks to
the Matron.]
It won't be necessary.
BLANCHE [faintly]:
Ask her to let go of me.
DOCTOR [to the Matron]:
Let go.
[The Matron releases her. Blanche extends her hands toward the Doctor. He draws her up gently
and supports her with his arm and leads her through the portieres.]
BLANCHE [holding tight to his arm]:
Whoever you are--I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
[The poker players stand back as Blanche and the Doctor cross the kitchen to the front door. She
allows him to lead her as if she were blind. As they go out on the porch, Stella cries out her
sister's name from where she is crouched a few steps up on the stairs.]
[Blanche walks on without turning, followed by the Doctor and the Matron. They go around the
corner of the building.]
[Eunice descends to Stella and places the child in her arms. It is wrapped in a pale blue blanket.
Stella accepts the child, sobbingly. Eunice continues downstairs and enters the kitchen where the
men, except for Stanley, are returning silently to their places about the table. Stanley has gone
out on the porch and stands at the foot of the steps looking at Stella.]
STANLEY [a bit uncertainly]:
Stella?
[She sobs with inhuman abandon. There is something luxurious in her complete surrender to
crying now that her sister is gone.]
STANLEY [voluptuously, soothingly]:
Now, honey. Now, love. Now, now, love.
[He kneels beside her and his fingers find the opening of her blouse] Now, now, love. Now,
love....
[The luxurious sobbing, the sensual murmur fade away under the swelling music of the "blue
piano" and the muted trumpet.]
STEVE:
This game is seven-card stud.



Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out, am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
