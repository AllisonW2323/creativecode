What i changed: formatting, it now rhymes, i also input a different text file, Romeo and Juliet, Bury a Friend, and A Streetcar Named Desire.  I chose these stories becuase they are about different kinds of love that don't work whether becuase of codepedence and abuse, or a young love that was not meant to last.  I chose to add a Billie Eilish song in order to tie the twos themes together better.  Since the song deals with her asking "why are you still here?  i hurt you" and things like that which i think add to Streetcar and Romeo because she exudes a very young kind of love while knowing more than her years. The first rhyme is easy to see, much like many flaws in many realtionships.  The other two rhymes are a little more hidden, one more than the other.  This is to symbolize how many people stay in bad realtionships even though it would be far better for them to leave, they can't see the signs that tell them they should leave.

I really like how the formatting is changed, the lines are now furthur apart and read better if they were to be read out loud.
