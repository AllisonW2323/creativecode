##In a Galaxy Very Near to Here


This is my code in which I have taken the script of Galaxy Quest and re-formatted it with the help of the programe known as Markovify.  Here is the google document(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kaFdPhb4uwIGv2WcyS3vJnBKBxgiNz7Q) it creates a PDF file of a Novel containing 55,734 words.  
If you wish to stay in Github then please click on the .py file also under "Novel".  


After reading through many iterations of text made from this code, I have found that while this story is most definitly its own thing, it still retains the spirit of the origional piece.  It comments on things that happen in the Movie Galaxy Quest while subverting many things that were doen in the film.  In a way, it is like a parody of the movie, which is interesting since Galaxy Quest was made to be both a parody and an omage to Star Trek.  




I have the file of the script for Galaxy Quest in this folder as well so you too may see what I have explained here.
