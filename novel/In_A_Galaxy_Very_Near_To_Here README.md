##In a Galaxy Very Near to Here

This is my code in which I have taken the script of Galaxy Quest and re-formatted it with the help of the program known as Markovify.  Here is the google document(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kaFdPhb4uwIGv2WcyS3vJnBKBxgiNz7Q) it creates a PDF file of a Novel containing 55,734 words.  
If you wish to stay in Github then please click on the .py file also under "Novel".  


This code is meant to create a novel like no one has seen yet, for each time it is run an entirely new idea comes into focus.  It is simple, and yet unique in its own special way.  It took a bit of tinkering to make sure that the words would print properly, coherently, and within the proper word count but the final output is worth it.  


After reading through many iterations of text made from this code, I have found that while this story is most definitely its own thing, it still retains the spirit of the original piece.  It comments on things that happen in the Movie Galaxy Quest while subverting many things that were done in the film.  In a way, it is like a parody of the movie, which is interesting since Galaxy Quest was made to be both a parody and an homage to Star Trek.  

So, in a way, each time this code is run a new parody of Galaxy Quest (and in turn, Star Trek) is made.  And I think that that is quite unique indeed.





I have the file of the script for Galaxy Quest in this folder as well so you too may see what I have explained here.
