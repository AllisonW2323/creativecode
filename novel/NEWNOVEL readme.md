I changed the text in question to galaxy quest and Sky High as they both have prominent characters called commander and Gwen. I had originally wanted to fix this by having a bunch of different texts that use the name commander prominently, but I found that using more than two would often cause the resulting PDF to be unreadable. I also formatted this novel so that it has paragraphs now.Â  It has 10 chapters that I have labeled "Commanders Log".

I made a new novel called SkyQuest and it is full of lines from both Sky High and Galaxy Quest.  

I feel like this version of my novel is far superior, it has paragraphs, spacing, and more to work from than the orgional which just had 1 text.


This is my code in which I have taken scripts and re-formatted them with the help of the program known as Markovify. it creates a PDF file of a Novel containing 60,000 words.
If you wish to stay in Github then please click on the .py file.

This code is meant to create a novel like no one has seen yet, for each time it is run an entirely new idea comes into focus. It is simple, and yet unique in its own special way. It took a bit of tinkering to make sure that the words would print properly, coherently, and within the proper word count but the final output is worth it.

After reading through many iterations of text made from this code, I have found that while this story is most definitely its own thing, it still retains the spirit of the original piece. It comments on things that happen in the Movie Galaxy Quest while subverting many things that were done in the film. In a way, it is like a parody of the movie, which is interesting since Galaxy Quest was made to be both a parody and an homage to Star Trek.
When talking about homage's, Sky High also does a great job of it with superhero movies.  Doing quite the same thing as Galaxy Quest did, which is why I felt like they should go together.

So, in a way, each time this code is run a new parody of Galaxy Quest and Sky High (and in turn, Star Trek and Super hero movies) is made. And I think that that is quite unique indeed.

I have the file of the script for Skyhigh and Galaxy quest in this folder as well so you too may see what I have explained here.  It is just one file.

I have also downloaded SkyQuest onto github so that you may see the finished product.
