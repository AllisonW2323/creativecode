#i changed the text in question to galaxy quest and sky high as they both have promient characters called commander and gwen.  I had orgionally wanted to fix
#this by having a bunch of different texts that use the name commander promenintly, but i found that using more than two would often cause the resulting PDF
#to be unreadable and not understandable.  I also formatted this novel so that it has paragraphs now.
