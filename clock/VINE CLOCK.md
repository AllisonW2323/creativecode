# Vine Clock


This is a clock that will only truly resonate with those of us alive right now.  Vine was a huge cultural phenomenon for the internet, suddenly people from all over the world could quote it and most people from other countries would be either to either recognize the vine or finish the quote.  

I decided to have my clock be full of vines because like vines the idea of the clock is one that connects people from all different countries.  You can ask, "what is the time?" in any language and people understand that you want the time on the clock.  This kind of relationship is one that I expect will continue to grow as the internet becomes more and more advanced.  I believe that we will continue to be more involved with other countries through these simple yet effective ways.

I have complied a list of 36 vines (1 TikTok as well because it is so good it might as well be a vine, and also to show that Vine was not a one-time thing, it is starting to happen again, albeit on a smaller scale, with TikTok.)

These vines are situated in 3 different parts of day, before 12pm, 12pm, and after 12pm.  In other words, Morning, Noon, and Evening.
These vines either match the light outside or the feeling one often gets at these times.  For example, I have several food vines for noon because while you often can't see what time it is outside, food is associated with noon in our culture.

I am really happy with how this has all turned out and hope that you appreciate it as well.

Side-note: Because my code randomly takes from an array of vines, it will sometimes keep picking the same one over and over, the fix for this is to simple play it again and it should stop repeating too much for a long while.
