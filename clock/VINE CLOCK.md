# Vine Clock


This is a clock that will only truly resonate with those of us alive right now.  Vine was a huge cultural phenomenon for the internet, suddenly people from all over the world could qoute it and most people from other countries would be either to either recognize the vine or finish the qoute.  

I decided to have my clock be full of vines becuase like vines the idea of the clock is one that connects people from all different countries.  You can ask, "what is the time?" in any language and people understand that you want the time on the clock.  This kind of relationship is one that I expect will contuine to grow as the internet becomes more nad mre advanced.  I belive that we will contuine to be more involved with other countires through these simple yet effective ways.

I have complied a list of 36 vines (1 Tik Tock as well becuase it is so good it might as well be a vine, and also to show that Vine was not a one time thing, it is starting to happen again, albeit on a smaller scale, with Tik Tock.)

These vines are situated in 3 different parts of day, before 12pm, 12pm, and after 12pm.  In other words, Morning, Noon, and Evening.
These vines either match the light outside or the feeling one often gets at these times.  For example, I have several food vines for noon becuase while you often can't see what time it is outside, food is assocaiated with noon in our culture.

I am really happy with how this has all turned out and hope that you appreaiacte it as well.

Sidenote: Becuase my code randomily takes from an array of vines, it will somtimes keep picking the same one over and over, the fix for this is to simple play it againa nd it should stop for a long while.
