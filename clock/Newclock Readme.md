For this revision, I decided to add more Vines onto the clock so that It could work better and not play the same ones over and over again.  I have added 43 new vines which altogether make up a Vine clock with 79 vines in it.

I really liked the way that this clock came out and I felt that the best way to make it better would be to add more vines.
