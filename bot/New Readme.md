New Bot Project!

This bot, @TumpToupeTroubl, was changed to now show twitter users the inner working of Trump's hair's mind.  In other words, the hair is now alive and has thoughts and is tweeting for us.  

I changed this bot to be more natural sounding and decided that I want it to be his hairs thoughts and not just what happened to his hair.  I feel like this change has made the bot feel and flow a lot better than it did before.  I really like the new direction I have taken this bot.  
The bots main purpose is to make fun of Trump because why not?  I feel like that has a large audience and will give many people a laugh.  Thats my main goal really, to be able to make people laugh, and I feel that this version of the bot is better at doing that.


This bot is still possible of over 200,000 possible combinations.

The bot is hosted at Cheap Bots Done Quick, the code is made with Tracery grammar. here: https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/TumpToupeTroubl
