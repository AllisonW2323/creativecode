# Bot Project

This bot, [@TumpToupeTroubl](https://twitter.com/TumpToupeTroubl), is made to tell twitter users where Trumps hair has gone in the world to provide silly comentary on its travels.  

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
