# Bot Project

This bot, [@RRAAAAARRL](https://twitter.com/RRAAAAARRL), is meant to create and share the kinds of sounds monsters used to make in old comic books -- monsters like [Gorgo](https://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=125180).

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
